meter resolution GFSAD30AUNZCNMOCE The monitoring of global cropland extent is critical for policymaking and provides important baseline data that are used in many agricultural cropland studies pertaining to water sustainability and food security The GFSAD30AUNZCNMOCE data product uses the pixelbased supervised classifier Random Forest RF to retrieve cropland extent from a combination of

30 meter resolution GFSAD30EUCEARUMECE The monitoring of global cropland extent is critical for policymaking and provides important baseline data that are used in many agricultural cropland studies pertaining to water sustainability and food security The GFSAD30EUCEARUMECE product uses a pixelbased supervised random forest machine learning algorithm to retrieve cropland extent from a combination of Landsat 7 Enhanced Thematic Mapper ETM Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager OLI data and elevation derived from the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission SRTM Version 3 data products Each

NameTELLUS_GRACGRFO_MASCON_CRI_GRID_RL061_V3DescriptionThis dataset contains gridded monthly global water storageheight anomalies relative to a timemean derived from GRACE and GRACEFO and processed at JPL using the Mascon approach RL061Mv03 This version of the data employs a Coastal Resolution Improvement CRI filter that reduces signal leakage errors across coastlines These data are provided in a single data file in netCDF format and can be used for analysis for ocean ice and hydrology phenomena The water storageheight anomalies are given in equivalent water thickness units cm The solution provided here is derived from solving for monthly gravity field variations in terms of geolocated spherical cap mass concentration functions rather than global spherical harmonic coefficients Additionally realistic geophysical information is introduced during the solution inversion to intrinsically remove correlated error Thus these Mascon grids do not need to be destriped or smoothed like traditional spherical harmonic gravity solutions The complete Mascon solution consists of 4551 relatively independent estimates of surface mass change that have been derived using an equalarea 3degree grid of individual mascons A subset of these individual mascons span coastlines and contain mixed land and ocean mass change signals In a postprocessing step the CRI filter is applied to those mixed landocean Mascons to separate land and ocean mass The land mask used to perform this separation is provided in the same directory as this dataset Since the individual mascons act as an inherent smoother on the gravity field a set of optional gain factors for continental hydrology applications that can be applied to the solution to study mass change signals at submascon resolution is also provided within the same data directory as the Mascon data This RL061Mv03 is an updated version of the previous Tellus JPL Mascon RL06Mv02 DOI 105067TEMSC3JC62 RL061Mv03 differs from RL06Mv02 only in

NameTELLUS_GRACGRFO_MASCON_CRI_GRID_RL061_V3DescriptionThis dataset contains gridded monthly global water storageheight anomalies relative to a timemean derived from GRACE and GRACEFO and processed at JPL using the Mascon approach RL061Mv03 This version of the data employs a Coastal Resolution Improvement CRI filter that reduces signal leakage errors across coastlines These data are provided in a single data file in netCDF format and can be used for analysis for ocean ice and hydrology phenomena The water storageheight anomalies are given in equivalent water thickness units cm The solution provided here is derived from solving for monthly gravity field variations in terms of geolocated spherical cap mass concentration functions rather than global spherical harmonic coefficients Additionally realistic geophysical information is introduced during the solution inversion to intrinsically remove correlated error Thus these Mascon grids do not need to be destriped or smoothed like traditional spherical harmonic gravity solutions The complete Mascon solution consists of 4551 relatively independent estimates of surface mass change that have been derived using an equalarea 3degree grid of individual mascons A subset of these individual mascons span coastlines and contain mixed land and ocean mass change signals In a postprocessing step the CRI filter is applied to those mixed landocean Mascons to separate land and ocean mass The land mask used to perform this separation is provided in the same directory as this dataset Since the individual mascons act as an inherent smoother on the gravity field a set of optional gain factors for continental hydrology applications that can be applied to the solution to study mass change signals at submascon resolution is also provided within the same data directory as the Mascon data This RL061Mv03 is an updated version of the previous Tellus JPL Mascon RL06Mv02 DOI 105067TEMSC3JC62 RL061Mv03 differs from RL06Mv02 only in
