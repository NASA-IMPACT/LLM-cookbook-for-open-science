Version 51 The GMSL trend is a 1dimensional time series of globally averaged Sea Surface Height Anomalies SSHA from TOPEXPoseidon Jason1 OSTMJason2 and Jason3 that covers September 1992 to present with a lag of up to 4 months The data are reported as variations relative to a 20year TOPEXJason collinear mean Bias adjustments and crosscalibrations were applied to ensure SSHA data are consistent across the missions Glacial Isostatic Adjustment GIA was also applied The data are available as a table in ASCII format Changes between the version 42 and version 5x releases are described in detail

individual 10day cycles from the TOPEXPoseidon Jason1 OSTMJason2 and Jason3 missions georeferenced to a mean reference orbit Altimeter data from the multimission Geophysical Data Records GDRs have been interpolated to a common reference orbit with biases and crosscalibrations applied so that the derived SSHA are consistent between satellites to form a single homogeneous climate data record Version 51 updates include the integration of Jason3 GDR_F data and the application of revised GDR_F standard internal tides and pole tide across missions  The data are in netCDF format and start in September 1992 Data extensions are appended to the file quarterly More information on data processing standards can be found in the v51 User Handbook Integrated MultiMission Ocean Altimeter Data for

Version 11 product MSLSP provides a Land Surface Phenology product for North America derived from Harmonized Landsat Sentinel2 HLS data Data from the combined Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager OLI and Sentinel2A and 2B Multispectral Instrument MSI provides the user community with dates of phenophase transitions including the timing of greenup maturity senescence and dormancy at 30 meter spatial resolution These data sets are useful for a wide range of applications including ecosystem and agroecosystem modeling monitoring the response of terrestrial ecosystems to climate variability and extreme events croptype discrimination and land cover land use and land cover change mappingProvided in the MSLSP product are layers for percent greenness onset greenness dates Enhanced Vegetative Index EVI2 amplitude and maximum EVI2 and data quality information for up to two phenological cycles per year For areas where the data values are missing due to cloud cover or other reasons the data gaps are filled with good quality values from the year directly preceding or following the product year A low resolution browse image representing maximum EVI is also available for each MSLSP30NA granuleread moreCharacteristicsImprovementsChanges from Previous VersionsModest changes were made to the spline fitting algorithm used to estimate the MSLSP30NA product in V011  Only gaps greater than 20 days were filled using observations from the outside of the target year to reduce the computational burden Sensitivity analyses demonstrated that this change had negligible impact on product resultsThe Quality Assurance QA fields were updated to reflect the changes in the gapfilling Version 1 included QA values from 17 whereas Version 11 includes QA values from 16 9 and 10Peak date

DataCitationRelated ProductsHomepageDataSearch Data CatalogMSLSP30NAv011DescriptionThe MultiSource Land Surface Phenology LSP Yearly North America 30 meter m Version 11 product MSLSP provides a Land Surface Phenology product for North America derived from Harmonized Landsat Sentinel2 HLS data Data from the combined Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager OLI and Sentinel2A and 2B Multispectral Instrument MSI provides the user community with dates of phenophase transitions including the timing of greenup maturity senescence and dormancy at 30 meter spatial resolution These data sets are useful for a wide range of applications including ecosystem and agroecosystem modeling monitoring the response of terrestrial ecosystems to climate variability and extreme events croptype discrimination and land cover land use and land cover change mappingProvided in the MSLSP product are layers for percent greenness onset greenness dates Enhanced Vegetative Index EVI2 amplitude and maximum EVI2 and data quality information for up to two phenological cycles per year For areas where the data values are missing due to cloud cover or other reasons the data gaps are filled with good quality values from the year directly preceding or following the product year A low resolution browse image representing maximum EVI is also available for each MSLSP30NA granuleread moreCharacteristicsImprovementsChanges from Previous VersionsModest changes were made to the spline fitting algorithm used to estimate the MSLSP30NA product in V011  Only gaps greater than 20 days were filled using observations from the outside of the target year to reduce the computational burden Sensitivity analyses demonstrated that this change had negligible impact on product resultsThe Quality Assurance QA fields were updated to reflect the changes in the gapfilling Version 1 included QA values from 17 whereas Version 11 includes QA values from 16 9 and 10Peak date corresponding to

NameJPL_RECON_GMSLDescriptionThis dataset contains reconstructed globalmean sea level evolution and the estimated contributing processes over 19002018 Reconstructed sea level is based on annualmean tidegauge observations and uses the virtualstation method to aggregate the individual observations into a global estimate The contributing processes consist of thermosteric changes glacier mass changes mass changes of the Greenland and Antarctic Ice Sheet and terrestrial water storage changes The glacier ice sheet and terrestrial water storage are estimated by combining GRACE observations 20032018 with longterm estimates from insitu observations and models Steric estimates are based on insitu temperature profiles The upper and lower bound represent the 5 and 95 percent confidence level The numbers are equal to the ones presented in Frederikse et al The causes of sealevel rise since 1900 Nature 2020This dataset was produced by the Heat and Ocean Mass from Gravity ESDR HOMAGE project

from fires that occurred within the Arctic Boreal and Vulnerability Experiment ABoVE Project domain in Alaska and Canada during 19852015 The fire perimeters were obtained from the Alaskan Interagency Coordination Center AICC and the Natural Resources Canada NRC fire occurrence datasets Only burns with an area larger than 200ha were included The dNBR for each burn scar at 30m pixel resolution was derived from pre and postburn Landsat 5 7 and 8 scenes within a 5km buffered area surrounding each burn scar using Landsat LEDAPS surface reflection image pairsScience KeywordsBIOSPHEREECOLOGICAL

2018 ECOSTRESS experienced an anomaly with its primary mass storage unit MSU ECOSTRESS has a primary and secondary MSU A and B On December 5 2018 the instrument was switched to the secondary MSU and science operations resumed On March 14 2019 the secondary MSU experienced a similar anomaly temporarily halting science acquisitions On May 15 2019 a new data acquisition approach was implemented and science acquisitions resumed To optimize the new acquisition approach TIR bands 2 4 and 5 are being downloaded The data products are as previously except the bands not downloaded contain fill values L1 radiance and L2 emissivity This approach was implemented from May 15 2019 through April 28 2023Data acquisition gap From February 8 to February 16 2020 an ECOSTRESS instrument issue resulted in a data anomaly that created striping in band 4 105 micron These data products have been reprocessed and are available for download No ECOSTRESS data were acquired on February 17 2020 due to the instrument being in SAFEHOLD Data acquired following the anomaly have not been affectedData acquisition ECOSTRESS has now successfully returned to 5band mode after being in 3band mode since 2019 This feature was successfully enabled following a Data Processing Unit firmware update version 41 to the payload on April 28 2023 To better balance contiguous science data scene variables 3band collection

reprocessed and are available for download No ECOSTRESS data were acquired on February 17 2020 due to the instrument being in SAFEHOLD Data acquired following the anomaly have not been affectedData acquisition ECOSTRESS has now successfully returned to 5band mode after being in 3band mode since 2019 This feature was successfully enabled following a Data Processing Unit firmware update version 41 to the payload on April 28 2023 To better balance contiguous science data scene variables 3band collection is currently being interleaved with 5band acquisitions over the orbital daynight periodsAbout

AST_08 is generated using the five Thermal Infrared TIR bands acquired either during the day or night time between 8 and 12 µm spectral range It contains surface temperatures at 90 m spatial resolution for the land areas only Surface kinetic temperature provides a vital input to studies of volcanism thermal inertia surface energy and highresolution mapping of fires This product is derived using the same algorithm as the ASTER Surface Emissivity AST_05 ProductSurface kinetic temperature is determined by applying <NAME> using the emissivity values from the TemperatureEmissivity Separation TES algorithm which uses atmospherically corrected ASTER surface radiance TIR data The TES algorithm first estimates emissivity in the TIR channels using the Normalized Emissivity Method NEM These estimates are used along with <NAME> to account for the landleaving TIR radiance that is due to sky irradiance That figure is subtracted from TIR radiance iteratively to estimate the emitted radiance from which temperature is calculated using the NEM moduleThe ASTER L2 Surface Kinetic Temperature data product is only available through NASAs Earthdata Search The ASTER Order Instructions

JuDocumentationUsing the DataAccess DataCitationRelated ProductsHomepageDataSearch Data CatalogHLSS30v002There are currently issues downloading Sentinel2 imagery to produce the S30 dataset The European Space Agency ESA is tracking and working to resolve this latency issue Until these issues are resolved S30 throughput may be less than 50 of nominal operationsDescriptionThe Harmonized Landsat Sentinel2 HLS project provides consistent surface reflectance data from the Operational Land Imager OLI aboard the joint NASAUSGS Landsat 8 satellite and the MultiSpectral Instrument MSI aboard <NAME> and Sentinel2B satellites The combined measurement enables global observations of the land every 23 days at 30meter m spatial resolution The HLS project uses a set of algorithms to obtain seamless products from OLI and MSI that include atmospheric correction cloud and cloudshadow masking spatial coregistration and common gridding illumination and view angle normalization and spectral bandpass adjustmentThe HLSS30 product provides 30m Nadir Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Function BRDFAdjusted Reflectance NBAR and is derived from Sentinel2A and Sentinel2B MSI data products The HLSS30 and HLSL30 products are gridded to the same resolution and Military Grid Reference System MGRS tiling system and thus are stackable for time series analysisThe HLSS30 product is provided in Cloud Optimized GeoTIFF COG format and each band is distributed as a separate COG There are 13 bands included in the HLSS30 product along with four angle bands and a quality assessment QA band See the User Guide for a more detailed description of the individual bands provided in the HLSS30 productread moreCharacteristicsImprovementsChanges from Previous VersionsAerosol QA bits from the

information related to cloud and aerosol quality along with QA mappings are provided under section 64 of the User GuideKnown IssuesThe atmospheric correction over bright targets occasionally retrieves unrealistically high aerosol and thus makes the surface reflectance too low High aerosol retrievals both false high aerosol and realistically high aerosol are masked when quality bits 6 and 7 are both set to 1 see Table 9 in the User Guide the corresponding spectral data should be discarded from analysisThere are known issues regarding the Fmask band of this data product that impacts HLSS30 data prior to February 1 2022 The HLS Fmask data band may have omission errors in water detection for cases where water detection using spectral data alone is difficult and omission and commission errors in cloud shadow detection for areas with great topographic relief This issue does not impact other bands in the datasetThere is a spike difference in HLSL30 and HLSS30 when generating NDVI index from granules after 2021 which was resolved with the integration of Landsat 9 in January 2023 however it was not back processed The HLS team is aware of this issue and is currently working on a fixEuropean Space Agency ESA started to add 1000 units to the scaled top of atmosphere TOA and surface reflectance in late January of 2022 and Interagency Implementation and Advanced Concepts Team IMPACT accordingly subtracts 1000 units after the TOA data is read Users unaware of this change saw a jump in the time seriesAbout the imageHLSS30 bands 432 showing croplands around Cedar Falls in

aerosol quality along with QA mappings are provided under section 64 of the User GuideKnown IssuesThe atmospheric correction over bright targets occasionally retrieves unrealistically high aerosol and thus makes the surface reflectance too low High aerosol retrievals both false high aerosol and realistically high aerosol are masked when quality bits 6 and 7 are both set to 1 see Table 9 in the User Guide the corresponding spectral data should be discarded from analysisThere are known issues regarding the Fmask band of this data product that impacts HLSS30 data prior to February 1 2022 The HLS Fmask data band may have omission errors in water detection for cases where water detection using spectral data alone is difficult and omission and commission errors in cloud shadow detection for areas with great topographic relief This issue does not impact other bands in the datasetThere is a spike difference in HLSL30 and HLSS30 when generating NDVI index from granules after 2021 which was resolved with the integration of Landsat 9 in January 2023 however it was not back processed The HLS team is aware of this issue and is currently working on a fixEuropean Space Agency ESA started to add 1000 units to the scaled top of atmosphere TOA and surface reflectance in late January of 2022 and Interagency Implementation and Advanced Concepts Team IMPACT accordingly subtracts 1000 units

correction over bright targets occasionally retrieves unrealistically high aerosol and thus makes the surface reflectance too low High aerosol retrievals both false high aerosol and realistically high aerosol are masked when quality bits 6 and 7 are both set to 1 see Table 9 in the User Guide the corresponding spectral data should be discarded from analysisFor scenes greater than or equal to 80 degrees north multiple overpasses can be gridded into a single MGRS tile resulting in an L30 granule with data sensed at two different times In this same area it is also possible that Landsat overpasses that should be gridded into a single MGRS tile are actually written as separate data files Finally for scenes with a latitude greater than or equal to 65 degrees north ascending Landsat scenes may have a slightly higher error in the BRDF correction because the algorithm is calibrated using descending scenesThere are known issues regarding the Fmask band of this data product that impacts HLSL30 data prior to April of 2022 The HLS Fmask data band may have omission errors in water detection for cases where water detection using spectral data alone is difficult and omission and commission errors in cloud shadow detection for areas with great topographic relief This issue does not impact other bands in the datasetThere is a spike difference in HLSL30 and HLSS30 when generating NDVI index from granules after 2021 which was resolved with the integration of Landsat 9 in January 2023 however it was not back processed The HLS team is aware of this issue and is

TOA brightness data from a virtual constellation of satellite sensors The Operational Land Imager OLI is housed aboard the joint NASAUSGS Landsat 8 and Landsat 9 satellites while the MultiSpectral Instrument MSI is mounted aboard <NAME> and Sentinel2B satellites The combined measurement enables global observations of the land every 23 days at 30meter m spatial resolution The HLS project uses a set of algorithms to obtain seamless products from OLI and MSI that include atmospheric correction cloud and cloudshadow masking spatial coregistration and common gridding illumination and view angle normalization and spectral bandpass adjustmentThe HLSL30 product provides 30m Nadir Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Function BRDFAdjusted Reflectance NBAR and is derived from Landsat 89 OLI data products The HLSS30 and HLSL30 products are gridded to the same resolution and Military Grid Reference System MGRS tiling system and thus are stackable for time series analysisThe HLSL30 product is provided in Cloud Optimized GeoTIFF COG format and each band is distributed as a separate file There are 11 bands included in the HLSL30 product along with one quality assessment QA band and four

in the ST product Visit the Landsat Collection 2 Surface Temperature data gaps due to missing ASTER GED page to learn more about missing ASTER GED data in ST products C2 ST products may display areas of blockiness over small surface targets Please access the Landsat Collection 2 Known Issues page to learn more Since ASTER GED represents average emissivity for 20002008 the emissivity for any particular Landsat observation needs to be adjusted to the surface conditions at the time of Landsat overpass An anomaly exists in vegetation adjustment of Landsat emissivity which results erroneous

Collection 2 Level1 product into surface temperature are described in the Landsat Atmospheric Auxiliary Data Format Control BookData products must contain both optical and thermal data eg LC08 products for Landsat 8 to be successfully processed to surface temperature as ASTER NDVI is required to temporally adjust the ASTER GED product to the target Landsat scene Therefore night time

been documented by Cook et al 2014For Landsat 7 ETM products Band 6 TOA BT and ST data are generated from ETM Band 6 High 6H and 6 Low 6L merged together The merged band contains unsaturated pixels from Band 6H If Band 6H pixels have a BT outside of the 6H dynamic range 240 to 322 Kelvin then 6L band pixels are used Pixels that are saturated in Band 6L remain saturated in the merged Band 6

merits emergency response Its severity is defined by assessing the degree to which households can meet basic survival needs and maintain normal livelihoods The Integrated Food Security Phase Classification IPC phases mapped above represent FEWS NETs analysis of the most likely acute food insecurity outcomes for nearterm 4 months into the future and mediumterm 8 months into the future projection periods FEWS NET classifications are IPCcompatible IPCcompatible analysis follow all IPC methodological protocols but do not necessarily reflect the consensus of national food security partners Countries that host FEWS NET offices and analysts are referred to as presence countries More detailed subnational analysis are produced for these countries which is reflected on FEWS NET maps by fully classifying by IPC phase the area within the country borders Countries routinely monitored by FEWS NET that do not have FEWS NET offices in the country are referred to as remote monitoring countries These countries are indicated on FEWS NET maps through the use of a colored outline of the national border The outline color represents the highest IPC classification for areas of concern within the country but not necessarily for the country as a wholeAnalyzing the Drivers of Acute Food InsecurityAcute food insecurity is a complex outcome typically driven by a combination of economic natural political andor social factors FEWS NET closely monitors and analyzes the nature location magnitude and duration of these complex drivers including but not limited to  ClimateFEWS NETs

merits emergency response Its severity is defined by assessing the degree to which households can meet basic survival needs and maintain normal livelihoods The\\xa0Integrated Food Security Phase Classification IPC phases mapped above represent FEWS NETs analysis of the most likely acute food insecurity outcomes for nearterm 4 months into the future and mediumterm 8 months into the future projection periods\\xa0FEWS NET classifications are\\xa0IPCcompatible IPCcompatible analysis follow all IPC methodological protocols but do not necessarily reflect the consensus of national food security partners\\xa0Countries that host FEWS NET offices and analysts are referred to as presence countries More detailed subnational analysis are produced for these countries which is reflected on FEWS NET maps by fully classifying by IPC phase the area within the country borders\\xa0Countries routinely monitored by FEWS NET that do not have FEWS NET offices in the country are referred to as remote monitoring countries These countries are indicated on FEWS NET maps through the use of a colored outline of the national border The outline color represents the highest IPC classification for areas of concern within the country but not necessarily for the country as a wholeAnalyzing the Drivers of Acute Food InsecurityAcute food insecurity is a complex outcome typically driven by a combination of economic natural political andor social factors FEWS NET closely monitors and analyzes the nature location magnitude and duration of these complex drivers including but not limited to

formally JPSS1 Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite VIIRS Active Fire detection product is based on the instruments 375 m nominal resolution data Compared to other coarser resolution 1km satellite fire detection products the improved 375 m data provide greater response over fires of relatively small areas as well as improved mapping of large fire perimeters Consequently the data are well suited for use in support of fire management eg near realtime alert systems as well as other science applications requiring improved fire mapping fidelity The 375 m product complements the

Global Multihazard Total Economic Loss Risk Deciles is a 25 minute grid of global multihazard total economic loss risks First for each of the considered hazards cyclones droughts earthquakes floods landslides and volcanoes subnational distributions of Gross Domestic Product GDP are computed using a methodology developed from Sachs et al 2003 Where applicable the contributions of subnational units to national GDP estimates the contribution ratio are determined using data of varied origin World Bank Development Indicators are substituted for GDP estimates of varied origin and the subnational GDP is estimated using the fore mentioned contribution ratios A subnational per capita GDP is derived and a final GDP estimate per grid cell is made based on grid cell population density A raw total economic loss is computed per grid cell using a regional economic loss rate derived from EMDAT records To more accurately reflect the confidence surrounding the economic loss estimate the range of losses are classified into deciles 10 classes of an approximately equal number of grid cells A multihazard index is generated by summing the top three deciles of the individual hazards This

Socioeconomic Pathways SSPs Representative Concentration Pathways RCPs and Shared Policy Assumptions SPAs for climate socioeconomic environmental and other related researchAbstractThe Shared Socioeconomic Pathways SSPs Literature Database v1 20142019 consists of biographic information abstracts and analysis of 1360 articles published from 2014 to 2019 that used the SSPs The database was generated from a Google Scholar search followed by a manual examination of the results for papers that made substantial use of the SSPs Each paper was then coded along a number of different dimensions including categories of types of papers or analysis number of subcategories for SSP Applications and SSP Extensions particular Shared Socioeconomic Pathways SSPs used particular Representative Concentration Pathways RCPs used and particular SSPRCP combinations used Over the past ten years the climate change research community developed a scenario framework combining alternative futures of climate and society to facilitate integrated research and consistent assessment to inform policy This framework consists of Shared Socioeconomic Pathways SSPs Representative Concentration Pathways RCPs and Shared Policy Assumptions SPAs which together describe alternative visions of how society and climate may evolve over the coming decades while providing a framework for combining these pathways in integrated studies The tracking of the use of this framework in the literature allows for assessment of how it is being used whether it is achieving its original goals and what improvements to the framework would benefit future researchRecommended CitationsGreen C D Carlisle B C ONeill B J van Ruijven C Boyer and  K Ebi        2021        Shared Socioeconomic Pathways SSPs

interpolation gauge data and climatological adjustmentOverview This algorithm is intended to intercalibrate merge and interpolate all satellite microwave precipitation estimates together with microwavecalibrated infrared IR satellite estimates precipitation gauge analyses and potentially other precipitation estimators at fine time and space scales for the TRMM and GPM eras over the entire globe The system is run several times for each observation time first giving a quick estimate IMERG Early Run and successively providing better estimates as more data arrive IMERG Late Run The final step uses monthly gauge data to create researchlevel products IMERG Final RunThe main differences between the IMERG Early and Late Run areThe halfhourly Final Run product uses a monthtomonth adjustment to the monthly Final Run product which combines the multisatellite data for the month with GPCC gauge analysis The adjustment within the month in each half hour is a ratio multiplier thats fixed for the month but spatially varyingThe Late Run is computed about 14 hours after observation time so sometimes a microwave overpass is not delivered in time for the Late Run but subsequently comes in and can be used in the Final  This would affect both the half hour in which the overpass occurs and potentially morphed values in nearby half hoursWe always advise people to use the Final Run for research unless their application will require the use of Early or Late data due to latency In such a case the application should be developed using the longrecord of the Early or Late as appropriate The vast majority of grid boxes have fairly similar Late and Final values over ocean and to a lesser extent over land Extreme value statistics are more sensitive to these details medians means and rootmean square difference are less sensitive NotesIMERG Final Run V06 data production halted in Sept 2021 Retrospective processing of IMERG Final commenced in July 2023 using the new IMERG

Precipitation Radar DPR and TRMM Precipitation Radar PR singleorbit rainfall estimates The objective of these radar algorithms is to generate f radaronly derived meteorological quantities on an instantaneous FOV field of view basis working from the level 1 radar products A subset of these estimates serves as input data to the level 2 combined radarradiometer algorithm and the level 3 combined and radaronly products The general idea behind these level 2 algorithms is to determine general characteristics of the precipitation correct for attenuation and estimate profiles of the precipitation water content rainfall rate When dualwavelength data are available the algorithm also estimates the particle size distributions in the phase of the precipitation ie liquid or frozen GPMs dualwavelength data will provide better estimates of rainfall and snowfall rates than those of the TRMM PR data Current Algorithm Version V07BDates Covered April 2014  Present DPR December 1997  March

Calibrated Radiance Product 1B01 contains calibrated radiances and auxiliary geolocation information from the five channels of the VIRS instrument for each pixel of each scan The data are stored in the Hierarchical Data Format HDF which includes both core and product specific metadata applicable to the VIRS measurements A file contains a single orbit of data with a file size of about 95 MB The EOSDIS swath structure is used to accommodate the actual geophysical data arrays There are 16 files of VIRS 1B01 data produced per dayFor channels 1 and 2 Level 1B radiances are derived from the Level 1A 1A01 sensor counts by computing calibration parameters gain and offset derived from the counts registered during space and solar andor lunar views New calibration parameters are produced every one to four weeks Channels 3 4 and 5 are calibrated using the internal blackbody and the space view These calibration parameters together with a quadratic term determined prelaunch are used to generate a counts vs radiance curve for each band which is then used to convert the earthview pixel counts to spectral radiancesGeolocation and channel data are written out for each pixel along the scan whereas the time stamp scan status containing scan quality information navigation calibration coefficients and solarsatellite geometry are specified on a perscan basis There are in general 18026 scans along the orbit preboost and 18223 postboost with each scan consisting of 261 pixels The scan width is about 720 km preboost and 833 km postboostLearn moreData Download URLDownload from the PPSProduct

intercalibrate merge and interpolate all satellite microwave precipitation estimates together with microwavecalibrated infrared IR satellite estimates precipitation gauge analyses and potentially other precipitation estimators at fine time and space scales for the TRMM and GPM eras over the entire globe\\xa0The system is run several times for each observation time first giving a quick estimate IMERG Early Run and successively providing better estimates as more data arrive IMERG Late Run The final step uses monthly gauge data to create researchlevel products IMERG Final RunThe main differences between the IMERG Early and Late Run areThe halfhourly Final Run product uses a monthtomonth adjustment to the monthly Final Run product which combines the multisatellite data for the month with GPCC\\xa0gauge analysis\\xa0The adjustment within the month in each half hour is a ratio multiplier thats fixed for the month but spatially varyingThe Late Run is computed about 14\\xa0hours after observation time so sometimes a microwave overpass is not delivered in time for the Late Run but subsequently comes in and can be used in the Final \\xa0This would affect both the half hour in which the overpass occurs and potentially morphed values in nearby half hoursWe always advise people to use the Final Run for research unless their application will require the use of Early or Late data due to latency In such a case the application should be developed using the longrecord of the Early or Late as appropriate The vast majority of grid boxes have fairly similar Late and Final values over ocean and to a lesser extent over land Extreme value statistics are more sensitive to these details medians means and rootmean square difference are less sensitive\\xa0NotesIMERG

Dualfrequency Precipitation Radar DPR and TRMM Precipitation Radar PR singleorbit rainfall estimates\\xa0The objective of these radar algorithms is to generate f radaronly derived meteorological quantities on an instantaneous FOV field of view basis working from the level 1 radar products A subset of these estimates serves as input data to the level 2 combined radarradiometer algorithm and the level 3 combined and radaronly products The general idea behind these level 2 algorithms is to determine general characteristics of the precipitation correct for attenuation and estimate profiles of the precipitation water content rainfall rate When dualwavelength data are available the algorithm also estimates the particle size distributions in the phase of the precipitation ie liquid or frozen GPMs dualwavelength data will provide better estimates of rainfall and snowfall rates than those of the TRMM PR data\\xa0Current Algorithm Version V07BDates Covered April 2014  Present DPR

pixel of each scan The data are stored in the Hierarchical Data Format HDF which includes both core and product specific metadata applicable to the VIRS measurements A file contains a single orbit of data with a file size of about 95 MB The EOSDIS swath structure is used to accommodate the actual geophysical data arrays There are 16 files of VIRS 1B01 data produced per dayFor channels 1 and 2 Level 1B radiances are derived from the Level 1A 1A01 sensor counts by computing calibration parameters gain and offset derived from the counts registered during space and solar andor lunar views New calibration parameters are produced every one to four weeks Channels 3 4 and 5 are calibrated using the internal blackbody and the space view These calibration parameters together with a quadratic term determined prelaunch are used to generate a counts vs radiance curve for each band which is then used to convert the earthview pixel counts to spectral radiancesGeolocation and channel data are written out for each pixel along the scan whereas the time stamp scan status containing scan quality information navigation calibration coefficients and solarsatellite geometry are specified on a perscan basis There are in general 18026 scans along the orbit preboost and 18223 postboost with each scan consisting of 261 pixels The scan width is about 720 km preboost and 833 km postboostLearn

DownloadMapsDocumentationMetadataPurposeTo provide estimates of urban and rural populations and land areas for the years 1990 2000 2015 for 234 countries and statistical areas with contiguous coastal elevations of less than or equal to 5m above sea level 510m above sea level and national totals using multiple updated data sources for comparative analysisAbstractThe Low Elevation Coastal Zone LECZ UrbanRural Population and Land Area Estimates Version 3 data set contains land areas with urban quasiurban rural and total populations counts within the LECZ for 234 countries and other recognized territories for the years 1990 2000 and 2015 This data set updates initial estimates for the LECZ population by drawing on a newer collection of input data and provides a range of estimates for atrisk population and land area Constructing accurate estimates requires highquality and methodologically consistent input data and the LECZv3 evaluates multiple data sources for population totals digital elevation model and spatiallydelimited urban classifications Users can find the paper Estimating Population and Urban Areas at Risk of Coastal Hazards 19902015 How data choices matter MacManus et al

NameTELLUS_GRACGRFO_MASCON_CRI_GRID_RL061_V3DescriptionThis dataset contains gridded monthly global water storageheight anomalies relative to a timemean derived from GRACE and GRACEFO and processed at JPL using the Mascon approach RL061Mv03 This version of the data employs a Coastal Resolution Improvement CRI filter that reduces signal leakage errors across coastlines These data are provided in a single data file in netCDF format and can be used for analysis for ocean ice and hydrology phenomena The water storageheight anomalies are given in equivalent water thickness units cm The solution provided here is derived from solving for monthly gravity field variations in terms of geolocated spherical cap mass concentration functions rather than global spherical harmonic coefficients Additionally realistic geophysical information is introduced during the solution inversion to intrinsically remove correlated error Thus these Mascon grids do not need to be destriped or smoothed like traditional spherical harmonic gravity solutions The complete Mascon solution consists of 4551 relatively independent estimates of surface mass change that have been derived using an equalarea 3degree grid of individual mascons A subset of these individual mascons span coastlines and contain mixed land and ocean mass change signals In a postprocessing step the CRI filter is applied to those mixed landocean Mascons to separate land and ocean mass The land mask used to perform this separation is provided in the same directory as this dataset Since the individual mascons act as an inherent smoother on the gravity field a set of optional gain factors for continental hydrology applications that can be applied to the solution to study mass change signals at submascon resolution is also provided within the same data directory as the Mascon data This RL061Mv03 is an updated version of the previous Tellus JPL Mascon RL06Mv02 DOI 105067TEMSC3JC62 RL061Mv03 differs from RL06Mv02 only in
