colleagues combined NASAs Black Marble night lights data product from the NASANOAA Suomi National Polarorbiting Partnership satellite with USGSNASA Landsat data and Googles OpenStreetMap to develop a

Loss Risk Deciles v1 2000Set OverviewData DownloadMapsMap ServicesMetadataPurposeTo provide a spatial surface of the proportional economic impacts of global cyclone hazardAbstractThe Global Cyclone Proportional Economic Loss Risk Deciles is a 25 minute grid of cyclone hazard economic loss as proportions of Gross Domestic Product GDP per analytical unit Estimates of GDP at risk are based on regional economic loss rates derived from historical records of the Emergency Events Database EMDAT Loss rates are weighted by the hazards frequency and distribution The methodology of Sachs et al 2003 is followed to determine baseline estimates of GDP per grid cell To better reflect the confidence surrounding the data and procedures the range of proportionalities is classified into deciles 10 class of an approximately equal number of grid cells of increasing risk This data set is the result of collaboration among the Columbia University Center for Hazards and Risk Research CHRR

FriedlDocumentationUsing the DataAccess DataCitationRelated ProductsHomepageDataSearch Data CatalogMSLSP30NAv011DescriptionThe MultiSource Land Surface Phenology LSP Yearly North America 30 meter m Version 11 product MSLSP provides a Land Surface Phenology product for North America derived from Harmonized Landsat Sentinel2 HLS data Data from the combined Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager OLI and Sentinel2A and 2B Multispectral Instrument MSI provides the user community with dates of phenophase transitions including the timing of greenup maturity senescence and dormancy at 30 meter spatial resolution These data sets are useful for a wide range of applications including ecosystem and agroecosystem modeling monitoring the response of terrestrial ecosystems to climate variability and extreme events croptype discrimination and land cover land use and land cover change mappingProvided in the MSLSP product are layers for percent greenness onset greenness dates Enhanced Vegetative Index EVI2 amplitude and maximum EVI2 and data quality information for up to two phenological cycles per year For areas where the data values are missing due to cloud cover or other reasons the data gaps are filled with good quality values from the year directly preceding or following the product year A low resolution browse image representing maximum EVI is also available for each MSLSP30NA granuleread moreCharacteristicsImprovementsChanges from Previous VersionsModest changes were made to the spline fitting algorithm used to estimate the MSLSP30NA product in V011  Only gaps greater than 20 days were filled using observations from the outside of the target year to reduce the computational burden Sensitivity analyses demonstrated that this change had negligible impact on product resultsThe Quality Assurance QA fields were updated to reflect the changes in the gapfilling Version 1 included QA values from 17 whereas Version 11 includes QA values from 16 9 and 10Peak date

2013Set OverviewData DownloadMapsMap ServicesDocumentationMetadataPurposeTo provide a global data set of average summer daytime maximumnighttime minimum land surface temperatures LSTs for urban extents as well as the LST difference between the urban area and the bufferAbstractThe Urban Heat Island UHI effect represents the relatively higher temperatures found in urban areas compared to surrounding rural areas owing to higher proportions of impervious surfaces and the release of waste heat from vehicles and heating and cooling systems Paved surfaces and built structures tend to absorb shortwave radiation from the sun and release longwave radiation after a lag of a few hours The Global Urban Heat Island UHI Data Set 2013 estimates the land surface temperature within urban areas in degrees Celsius average summer daytime maximum and average summer nighttime minimum as well as the difference between those temperatures and the temperatures in surrounding rural areas defined as a 10km buffer around the urban extent Urban extents are from SEDACs Global RuralUrban Mapping Project Version 1 GRUMPv1 and land surface temperatures are from SEDACs Global Summer Land

NameTELLUS_GRACGRFO_MASCON_CRI_GRID_RL061_V3DescriptionThis dataset contains gridded monthly global water storageheight anomalies relative to a timemean derived from GRACE and GRACEFO and processed at JPL using the Mascon approach RL061Mv03 This version of the data employs a Coastal Resolution Improvement CRI filter that reduces signal leakage errors across coastlines These data are provided in a single data file in netCDF format and can be used for analysis for ocean ice and hydrology phenomena The water storageheight anomalies are given in equivalent water thickness units cm The solution provided here is derived from solving for monthly gravity field variations in terms of geolocated spherical cap mass concentration functions rather than global spherical harmonic coefficients Additionally realistic geophysical information is introduced during the solution inversion to intrinsically remove correlated error Thus these Mascon grids do not need to be destriped or smoothed like traditional spherical harmonic gravity solutions The complete Mascon solution consists of 4551 relatively independent estimates of surface mass change that have been derived using an equalarea 3degree grid of individual mascons A subset of these individual mascons span coastlines and contain mixed land and ocean mass change signals In a postprocessing step the CRI filter is applied to those mixed landocean Mascons to separate land and ocean mass The land mask used to perform this separation is provided in the same directory as this dataset Since the individual mascons act as an inherent smoother on the gravity field a set of optional gain factors for continental hydrology applications that can be applied to the solution to study mass change signals at submascon resolution is also provided within the same data directory as the Mascon data This RL061Mv03 is an updated version of the previous Tellus JPL Mascon RL06Mv02 DOI 105067TEMSC3JC62 RL061Mv03 differs from RL06Mv02 only in the Level1B accelerometer transplant data that is used for the GF2 GRACEFO 2 satellite RL061Mv03 uses the ACH data product For more information please visit

NameJPL_RECON_GMSLDescriptionThis dataset contains reconstructed globalmean sea level evolution and the estimated contributing processes over 19002018 Reconstructed sea level is based on annualmean tidegauge observations and uses the virtualstation method to aggregate the individual observations into a global estimate The contributing processes consist of thermosteric changes glacier mass changes mass changes of the Greenland and Antarctic Ice Sheet and terrestrial water storage changes The glacier ice sheet and terrestrial water storage are estimated by combining GRACE observations 20032018 with longterm estimates from insitu observations and models Steric estimates are based on insitu temperature profiles The upper and lower bound represent the 5 and 95 percent confidence level

RunResearchquality gridded global multisatellite precipitation estimates with quasiLagrangian time interpolation gauge data and climatological adjustmentOverview This algorithm is intended to intercalibrate merge and interpolate all satellite microwave precipitation estimates together with microwavecalibrated infrared IR satellite estimates precipitation gauge analyses and potentially other precipitation estimators at fine time and space scales for the TRMM and GPM eras over the entire globe\\xa0The system is run several times for each observation time first giving a quick estimate IMERG Early Run and successively providing better estimates as more data arrive IMERG Late Run The final step uses monthly gauge data to create researchlevel products IMERG Final RunThe main differences between the IMERG Early and Late Run areThe halfhourly Final Run product uses a monthtomonth adjustment to the monthly Final Run product which combines the multisatellite data for the month with GPCC\\xa0gauge analysis\\xa0The adjustment within the month in each half hour is a ratio multiplier thats fixed for the month but spatially varyingThe Late Run is computed about 14\\xa0hours after observation time so sometimes a microwave overpass is not delivered in time for the Late Run but subsequently comes in and can be used in the Final \\xa0This would affect both the half hour in which the overpass occurs and potentially morphed values in nearby half hoursWe always advise people to use the Final Run for research unless their application will require the use of Early or Late data due to latency In such a case the application should be developed using the longrecord of the Early or Late as appropriate The vast majority of grid boxes have fairly similar Late and Final values over ocean and to a lesser extent over land Extreme value statistics are more sensitive to these details medians means and rootmean square difference are less sensitive\\xa0NotesIMERG

Dualfrequency Precipitation Radar DPR and TRMM Precipitation Radar PR singleorbit rainfall estimates\\xa0The objective of these radar algorithms is to generate f radaronly derived meteorological quantities on an instantaneous FOV field of view basis working from the level 1 radar products A subset of these estimates serves as input data to the level 2 combined radarradiometer algorithm and the level 3 combined and radaronly products The general idea behind these level 2 algorithms is to determine general characteristics of the precipitation correct for attenuation and estimate profiles of the precipitation water content rainfall rate When dualwavelength data are available the algorithm also estimates the particle size distributions in the phase of the precipitation ie liquid or frozen GPMs dualwavelength data will provide better estimates of rainfall and snowfall rates than those of the TRMM PR data\\xa0Current Algorithm Version V07BDates Covered April 2014  Present DPR

pixel of each scan The data are stored in the Hierarchical Data Format HDF which includes both core and product specific metadata applicable to the VIRS measurements A file contains a single orbit of data with a file size of about 95 MB The EOSDIS swath structure is used to accommodate the actual geophysical data arrays There are 16 files of VIRS 1B01 data produced per dayFor channels 1 and 2 Level 1B radiances are derived from the Level 1A 1A01 sensor counts by computing calibration parameters gain and offset derived from the counts registered during space and solar andor lunar views New calibration parameters are produced every one to four weeks Channels 3 4 and 5 are calibrated using the internal blackbody and the space view These calibration parameters together with a quadratic term determined prelaunch are used to generate a counts vs radiance curve for each band which is then used to convert the earthview pixel counts to spectral radiancesGeolocation and channel data are written out for each pixel along the scan whereas the time stamp scan status containing scan quality information navigation calibration coefficients and solarsatellite geometry are specified on a perscan basis There are in general 18026 scans along the orbit preboost and 18223 postboost with each scan consisting of 261 pixels The scan width is about 720 km preboost and 833 km postboostLearn

merits emergency response Its severity is defined by assessing the degree to which households can meet basic survival needs and maintain normal livelihoods The Integrated Food Security Phase Classification IPC phases mapped above represent FEWS NETs analysis of the most likely acute food insecurity outcomes for nearterm 4 months into the future and mediumterm 8 months into the future projection periods FEWS NET classifications are IPCcompatible IPCcompatible analysis follow all IPC methodological protocols but do not necessarily reflect the consensus of national food security partners Countries that host FEWS NET offices and analysts are referred to as presence countries More detailed subnational analysis are produced for these countries which is reflected on FEWS NET maps by fully classifying by IPC phase the area within the country borders Countries routinely monitored by FEWS NET that do not have FEWS NET offices in the country are referred to as remote monitoring countries These countries are indicated on FEWS NET maps through the use of a colored outline of the national border The outline color represents the highest IPC classification for areas of concern within the country but not necessarily for the country as a wholeAnalyzing the Drivers of Acute Food InsecurityAcute food insecurity is a complex outcome typically driven by a combination of economic natural political andor social factors FEWS NET closely monitors and analyzes the nature location magnitude and duration of these complex drivers including but not limited to  ClimateFEWS NETs

merits emergency response Its severity is defined by assessing the degree to which households can meet basic survival needs and maintain normal livelihoods The\\xa0Integrated Food Security Phase Classification IPC phases mapped above represent FEWS NETs analysis of the most likely acute food insecurity outcomes for nearterm 4 months into the future and mediumterm 8 months into the future projection periods\\xa0FEWS NET classifications are\\xa0IPCcompatible IPCcompatible analysis follow all IPC methodological protocols but do not necessarily reflect the consensus of national food security partners\\xa0Countries that host FEWS NET offices and analysts are referred to as presence countries More detailed subnational analysis are produced for these countries which is reflected on FEWS NET maps by fully classifying by IPC phase the area within the country borders\\xa0Countries routinely monitored by FEWS NET that do not have FEWS NET offices in the country are referred to as remote monitoring countries These countries are indicated on FEWS NET maps through the use of a colored outline of the national border The outline color represents the highest IPC classification for areas of concern within the country but not necessarily for the country as a wholeAnalyzing the Drivers of Acute Food InsecurityAcute food insecurity is a complex outcome typically driven by a combination of economic natural political andor social factors FEWS NET closely monitors and analyzes the nature location magnitude and duration of these complex drivers including but not limited to

global cyclone hazardAbstractThe Global Cyclone Total Economic Loss Risk Deciles is a 25 minute grid of global cyclone total economic loss risks A process of spatially allocating Gross Domestic Product GDP based upon the Sachs et al 2003 methodology is utilized  First the proportional contributions of subnational units to their respective national GDP are determined using sources of various origins The contribution rates are then applied to published World Bank Development Indicators to determine a GDP value for the subnational unit Once the national GDP is spatially stratified into the smallest administrative units available GDP values for grid cells are derived using population distribution data A per capita contribution value is determined within each subnational unit and this value is multiplied by the population per grid cell as determined from Gridded Population of the World Version 3 GPWv3 data Once a GDP value is determined on a per grid cell basis then the regionally variable loss rate as derived from the historical records of EMDAT is used to determine the total economic loss risks posed to a grid cell by cyclone hazards The final surface does not present absolute values of total economic loss but rather a relative decile 110 with increasing risk ranking of grid cells based upon the calculated economic loss risks This data set is the result of

Global Multihazard Total Economic Loss Risk Deciles is a 25 minute grid of global multihazard total economic loss risks First for each of the considered hazards cyclones droughts earthquakes floods landslides and volcanoes subnational distributions of Gross Domestic Product GDP are computed using a methodology developed from Sachs et al 2003 Where applicable the contributions of subnational units to national GDP estimates the contribution ratio are determined using data of varied origin World Bank Development Indicators are substituted for GDP estimates of varied origin and the subnational GDP is estimated using the fore mentioned contribution ratios A subnational per capita GDP is derived and a final GDP estimate per grid cell is made based on grid cell population density A raw total economic loss is computed per grid cell using a regional economic loss rate derived from EMDAT records To more accurately reflect the confidence surrounding the economic loss estimate the range of losses are classified into deciles 10 classes of an approximately equal number of grid cells A multihazard index is generated by summing the top three deciles of the individual hazards This

Loss Risk Deciles v1 2000Set OverviewData DownloadMapsMetadataPurposeTo identify areas of the world that are at greater risk of multihazard total economic lossAbstractThe Global Multihazard Total Economic Loss Risk Deciles is a 25 minute grid of global multihazard total economic loss risks First for each of the considered hazards cyclones droughts earthquakes floods landslides and volcanoes subnational distributions of Gross Domestic Product GDP are computed using a methodology developed from Sachs et al 2003 Where applicable the contributions of subnational units to national GDP estimates the contribution ratio are determined using data of varied origin World Bank Development Indicators are substituted for GDP estimates of varied origin and the subnational GDP is estimated using the fore mentioned contribution ratios A subnational per capita GDP is derived and a final GDP estimate per grid cell is made based on grid cell population density A raw total economic loss is computed per grid cell using a regional economic loss rate derived from EMDAT records To more accurately reflect the confidence surrounding the economic loss estimate the range of losses are classified into deciles 10 classes of an approximately equal number of grid cells A multihazard index is generated by summing the top three deciles of the individual hazards This data set is the

both brightness and extent of nocturnal low lights over two decades while minimizing the spatial overextent overglow and bright saturation that compromise the DMSPOLS composites The map product utilizes annual DMSPOLS stable lights composites produced by the NOAA Earth Observation Group and archived at the NOAA National Geophysical Data Center NGDC in a tritemporal global change map To achieve greater spatial resolution and radiometric accuracy the DMSPOLS composites are coregistered and fused with the 2015 VIIRS annual composite from NGDC The final product therefore retains the

dataset contains differenced Normalized Burned Ratio dNBR at 30m resolution calculated for burn scars from fires that occurred within the Arctic Boreal and Vulnerability Experiment ABoVE Project domain in Alaska and Canada during 19852015 The fire perimeters were obtained from the Alaskan Interagency Coordination Center AICC and the Natural Resources Canada NRC fire occurrence datasets Only burns with an area larger than 200ha were included The dNBR for each burn scar at 30m pixel resolution was derived from pre and postburn Landsat 5 7 and 8 scenes within a 5km buffered area surrounding

DownloadDocumentationMetadataPurposeTo provide a literature database tracking the use of a global scenarios framework consisting of Shared Socioeconomic Pathways SSPs Representative Concentration Pathways RCPs and Shared Policy Assumptions SPAs for climate socioeconomic environmental and other related researchAbstractThe Shared Socioeconomic Pathways SSPs Literature Database v1 20142019 consists of biographic information abstracts and analysis of 1360 articles published from 2014 to 2019 that used the SSPs The database was generated from a Google Scholar search followed by a manual examination of the results for papers that made substantial use of the SSPs Each paper was then coded along a number of different dimensions including categories of types of papers or analysis number of subcategories for SSP Applications and SSP Extensions particular Shared Socioeconomic Pathways SSPs used particular Representative Concentration Pathways RCPs used and particular SSPRCP combinations used Over the past ten years the climate change research community developed a scenario framework combining alternative futures of climate and society to facilitate integrated research and consistent assessment to inform policy This framework consists of Shared Socioeconomic Pathways SSPs Representative Concentration Pathways RCPs and Shared Policy Assumptions SPAs which together describe alternative visions of how society and climate may evolve over the coming decades while providing a framework for combining these pathways in integrated studies The tracking of the use of this framework in the literature allows for assessment of how it is being used whether it is achieving its original goals and what improvements to the framework would benefit future

minus outmigration per onekilometer grid cell on a decadal basis for the 1970s 1980s and 1990sAbstractThe Global Estimated Net Migration by Decade 19702000 data set provides estimates of net migration over the three decades from 1970 to 2000 Because of the lack of globally consistent data on migration indirect estimation methods were used The authors relied on a combination of data on spatial population distribution for four time slices 1970 1980 1990 and 2000 and subnational rates of natural increase in order to derive estimates of net migration on a 30 arcsecond 1km grid cell basis Net migration was estimated by subtracting the population in time period 2 from the population in time period 1 and then subtracting the natural increase births minus deaths The residual was considered to be net migration inmigrants minus outmigrants  The authors ran 13 geospatial net migration estimation models based on outputs from the same number of imputation runs for urban and rural rates of natural increaseThis data set represents the average of those runs These data are reliable at broad scales of analysis eg ecosystems or regions but are generally not reliable for local level analyses

base year grids based on the Shared Socioeconomic Pathways SSPs data at a resolution of 1km about 30 arcseconds for climate socioeconomic environmental and other related researchAbstractThe Global 1km Downscaled Urban Land Extent Projection and Base Year Grids by SSP Scenarios 20002100 consists of global SSPconsistent spatial urban land fraction data for the base year 2000 and projections at tenyear intervals for 20102100 at a resolution of 1km about 30 arcseconds An algorithm was developed and validated to downscale the 18degree resolution data set to 1km resolution For a given decade the downscaling algorithm allocates the 18degree decadal amount of urban land expansion to 1km grid cells in proportion to their total urban land amounts at the beginning of the decade The algorithm uses an iterative process to collect any overflows from already highlydeveloped 1km grid cells and then allocates them to 1km grid cells that are not yet fully developed This iterative process repeats itself until all 18degree amounts of urban land expansion are allocated to 1km grid cells with no overflow The downscaling process is applied decade by decade throughout the 21st century for each

US Air Force Defense Meteorological Satellite Program DMSP Operational Linescan System OLS with a stable night light composite from the next generation Suomi National Polarorbiting Partnership NPP Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite VIIRS DayNight Band to map the spatial distribution and temporal evolution of global nighttime lights between 1992 and 2015 The product visualizes changes in both brightness and extent of nocturnal low lights over two decades while minimizing the spatial overextent overglow and bright saturation that compromise the DMSPOLS composites The map product utilizes annual DMSPOLS stable lights composites produced by the NOAA Earth Observation Group and archived at the NOAA National Geophysical Data Center NGDC in a tritemporal global change map To achieve greater spatial resolution and radiometric accuracy the DMSPOLS composites are coregistered and fused with the 2015 VIIRS annual composite from NGDC The final product therefore retains the

Version 51 The GMSL trend is a 1dimensional time series of globally averaged Sea Surface Height Anomalies SSHA from TOPEXPoseidon Jason1 OSTMJason2 and Jason3 that covers September 1992 to present with a lag of up to 4 months The data are reported as variations relative to a 20year TOPEXJason collinear mean Bias adjustments and crosscalibrations were applied to ensure SSHA data are consistent across the missions Glacial Isostatic Adjustment GIA was also applied The data are available as a table in ASCII format Changes between the version 42 and version 5x releases are described in detail

Ocean Altimeter Data for Climate Research Version 51 The GMSL trend is a 1dimensional time series of globally averaged Sea Surface Height Anomalies SSHA from TOPEXPoseidon Jason1 OSTMJason2 and Jason3 that covers September 1992 to present with a lag of up to 4 months The data are reported as variations relative to a 20year TOPEXJason collinear mean Bias adjustments and crosscalibrations were applied to ensure SSHA data are consistent across the missions Glacial Isostatic Adjustment GIA was also applied The data are available as a table in ASCII format Changes between the version 42 and

JuDocumentationUsing the DataAccess DataCitationRelated ProductsHomepageDataSearch Data CatalogHLSS30v002There are currently issues downloading Sentinel2 imagery to produce the S30 dataset The European Space Agency ESA is tracking and working to resolve this latency issue Until these issues are resolved S30 throughput may be less than 50 of nominal operationsDescriptionThe Harmonized Landsat Sentinel2 HLS project provides consistent surface reflectance data from the Operational Land Imager OLI aboard the joint NASAUSGS Landsat 8 satellite and the MultiSpectral Instrument MSI aboard <NAME> and Sentinel2B satellites The combined measurement enables global observations of the land every 23 days at 30meter m spatial resolution The HLS project uses a set of algorithms to obtain seamless products from OLI and MSI that include atmospheric correction cloud and cloudshadow masking spatial coregistration and common gridding illumination and view angle normalization and spectral bandpass adjustmentThe HLSS30 product provides 30m Nadir Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Function BRDFAdjusted Reflectance NBAR and is derived from Sentinel2A and Sentinel2B MSI data products The HLSS30 and HLSL30 products are gridded to the same resolution and Military Grid Reference System MGRS tiling system and thus are stackable for time series analysisThe HLSS30 product is provided in Cloud Optimized GeoTIFF COG format and each band is distributed as a separate COG There are 13 bands included in the HLSS30 product along with four angle bands and a quality assessment QA band See the User Guide for a more detailed description of the individual bands provided in the HLSS30 productread moreCharacteristicsImprovementsChanges from Previous VersionsAerosol QA bits from the

information related to cloud and aerosol quality along with QA mappings are provided under section 64 of the User GuideKnown IssuesThe atmospheric correction over bright targets occasionally retrieves unrealistically high aerosol and thus makes the surface reflectance too low High aerosol retrievals both false high aerosol and realistically high aerosol are masked when quality bits 6 and 7 are both set to 1 see Table 9 in the User Guide the corresponding spectral data should be discarded from analysisThere are known issues regarding the Fmask band of this data product that impacts HLSS30 data prior to February 1 2022 The HLS Fmask data band may have omission errors in water detection for cases where water detection using spectral data alone is difficult and omission and commission errors in cloud shadow detection for areas with great topographic relief This issue does not impact other bands in the datasetThere is a spike difference in HLSL30 and HLSS30 when generating NDVI index from granules after 2021 which was resolved with the integration of Landsat 9 in January 2023 however it was not back processed The HLS team is aware of this issue and is currently working on a fixEuropean Space Agency ESA started to add 1000 units to the scaled top of atmosphere TOA and surface reflectance in late January of 2022 and Interagency Implementation and Advanced Concepts Team IMPACT accordingly subtracts 1000 units after the TOA data is read Users unaware of this change saw a jump in the time seriesAbout the imageHLSS30 bands 432 showing croplands around Cedar Falls in

degrees north multiple overpasses can be gridded into a single MGRS tile resulting in an L30 granule with data sensed at two different times In this same area it is also possible that Landsat

provides consistent surface reflectance SR and top of atmosphere TOA brightness data from a virtual constellation of satellite sensors The Operational Land Imager OLI is housed aboard the joint NASAUSGS Landsat 8 and Landsat 9 satellites while the MultiSpectral Instrument MSI is mounted aboard <NAME> and Sentinel2B satellites The combined measurement enables global observations of the land every 23 days at 30meter m spatial resolution The HLS project uses a set of algorithms to obtain seamless products from OLI and MSI that include atmospheric correction cloud and cloudshadow masking spatial coregistration and common gridding illumination and view angle normalization and spectral bandpass adjustmentThe HLSL30 product provides 30m Nadir Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Function BRDFAdjusted Reflectance NBAR and is derived from Landsat 89 OLI data products The HLSS30 and HLSL30 products are gridded to the same resolution and Military Grid Reference System MGRS tiling system and thus are stackable for time series analysisThe HLSL30 product is provided in Cloud Optimized GeoTIFF COG format and each band is distributed as a separate file There are 11 bands included in the HLSL30 product along with one quality assessment QA band and four angle bands See the User Guide for a more detailed description of the individual bands provided in the HLSL30 productread

section 64 of the User GuideKnown IssuesThe atmospheric correction over bright targets occasionally retrieves unrealistically high aerosol and thus makes the surface reflectance too low High aerosol retrievals both false high aerosol and realistically high aerosol are masked when quality bits 6 and 7 are both set to 1 see Table 9 in the User Guide the corresponding spectral data should be discarded from analysisFor scenes greater than or equal to 80 degrees north multiple overpasses can be gridded into a single MGRS tile resulting in an L30 granule with data sensed at two different times In this same area it is also possible that Landsat overpasses that should be gridded into a single MGRS tile are actually written as separate data files Finally for scenes with a latitude greater than or equal to 65 degrees north ascending Landsat scenes may have a slightly higher error in the BRDF correction because the algorithm is calibrated using descending scenesThere are known issues regarding the Fmask band of this data product that impacts HLSL30 data prior to April of 2022 The HLS Fmask data band may have omission errors in water detection for cases where water detection using spectral data alone is difficult and omission and commission errors in cloud shadow detection for areas with great topographic relief This issue does not impact other bands in the datasetThere is a spike difference in HLSL30 and HLSS30 when generating NDVI index from granules after 2021 which was resolved with the integration of Landsat 9 in January 2023 however it was not back processed

Constraints and Caveats Most Collection 2 Landsat 49 daylit descending acquisitions surface reflectance scenes can be processed to a surface temperature product but please note the followingSince ASTER GED data are used in the generation of the Landsat surface temperature product when ASTER GED data are missing there will be missing data in the ST product Visit the Landsat Collection 2 Surface Temperature data gaps due to missing ASTER GED page to learn more about missing ASTER GED data in ST products C2 ST products may display areas of blockiness over small surface targets Please access the Landsat Collection 2 Known Issues page to learn more Since ASTER GED represents average emissivity for 20002008 the emissivity for any particular Landsat observation needs to be adjusted to the surface conditions at the time of Landsat overpass An anomaly exists in vegetation adjustment of Landsat emissivity which results erroneous Surface Temperature values wherever NDVI has changed significantly between the ASTER and Landsat eras Please access the Landsat Collection 2 Known Issues page to learn more GEOS5 FPIT data are used to generate surface temperature products from 2000 to present NASAs MERRA2 data are used to generate surface temperature products from 1982 to 1999Atmospheric auxiliary data used for processing a Collection 2 Level1 product into surface temperature are described in the Landsat Atmospheric Auxiliary Data Format Control BookData products must contain both optical and thermal data eg LC08 products for Landsat 8 to be successfully processed to surface temperature as ASTER NDVI is required to temporally adjust the ASTER GED product to the target Landsat scene Therefore night time acquisitions cannot be processed to surface temperatureA known error exists in the surface temperature retrievals relative to clouds and possibly cloud shadows The characterization of these issues has been documented by Cook et al 2014For Landsat 7 ETM products Band 6 TOA BT and ST data are generated from ETM Band 6 High 6H and 6 Low 6L merged together The merged band contains unsaturated pixels from Band 6H If Band 6H pixels have a BT outside of the 6H dynamic

DataAccess DataCitationRelated ProductsHomepageDataSearch Data CatalogAST_08v003DescriptionThe Terra Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer ASTER Surface Kinetic Temperature AST_08 is generated using the five Thermal Infrared TIR bands acquired either during the day or night time between 8 and 12 µm spectral range It contains surface temperatures at 90 m spatial resolution for the land areas only Surface kinetic temperature provides a vital input to studies of volcanism thermal inertia surface energy and highresolution mapping of fires This product is derived using the same algorithm as the ASTER Surface Emissivity AST_05 ProductSurface kinetic temperature is determined by applying <NAME> using the emissivity values from the TemperatureEmissivity Separation TES algorithm which uses atmospherically corrected ASTER surface radiance TIR data The TES algorithm first estimates emissivity in the TIR channels using the Normalized Emissivity Method NEM These estimates are used along with <NAME> to account for the landleaving TIR radiance that is due to sky irradiance That figure is subtracted from TIR radiance iteratively to estimate the emitted radiance from which temperature is calculated using the NEM moduleThe ASTER L2 Surface Kinetic Temperature data product is only available through NASAs Earthdata Search The ASTER Order Instructions provide stepbystep directions for ordering this productread moreCharacteristicsImprovementsChanges from Previous VersionsThe Science Scalable Scriptsbased Science Processor for Missions S4PM Version 34 algorithm has additional input data options that provide better input data coverage simultaneously acquired MODIS data versus 6hourly modeled NCEP input data and consequently more accurate Level 2 output data The updated algorithm includes the following improvementsA new option has been added to use MODIS Version 61 MOD07_L2 Temperature Water Vapor and Pressure inputs The default order option will remain as National Centers for Environmental Prediction NCEPGlobal Data Assimilation System GDASThe default for the Ozone input data was switched from NCEPTelevision Infrared Observation Satellite TIROS Operational Vertical Sounder TOVS to the new Total Ozone Analysis using Solar Backscatter UltraViolet Version 2 SBUV2 and TOVS TOASTEarth ProbeTotal Ozone Mapping Spectrometer EPTOMS optionThe Level 2 algorithm has been updated to provide a fall back option for the TemperatureWater VaporPressure and Ozone input selections Both selections will automatically revert to the next lower input if the selected input is not availableThe TemperatureWater VaporPressure input will fall back from MOD07 to NCEPGDAS then to ClimatologyThe Ozone input will fall back from TOASTEPTOMS to OZ_DLYTOVS then to ClimatologyStarting June 23 2021 radiometric calibration coefficient Version 5 RCC V5 will be applied to newly observed ASTER data and archived ASTER data products Details regarding RCC V5 are described in the following journal articleTsuchida S <NAME> Kouyama T <NAME> A Arai K CzaplaMyers JS Biggar SF and Thome KJ 2020 Radiometric Degradation Curves for the ASTER VNIR Processing Using Vicarious and Lunar Calibrations Remote Sensing v 12 no 3 at httpsdoiorg103390rs12030427As of December 15 2021 the LP DAAC has implemented changes to ASTER PGE Version 34 which will affect all ASTER Level 2 ondemand products  Changes includeAura Ozone Monitoring Instrument OMI has been added as one of the ancillary ozone inputs for any observations made after May 27 2020  The sequence of fallbacks for ozone will remain the sameToolkit has been updated from Version 5217 to 5220  Users may notice minor differences between the two versions  Differences may include minuscule changes in digital numbers around the peripheral of the granule and boundaries of a cloud for Surface Reflectance and Surface Radiance AST07 and AST09 QA Data Plane depending on the Operating System and libraries being used by the user to process the dataAdditionally Climatology which is one of the inputs for Ozone and Moisture Temperature and Pressures MTP will be removed from the Earthdata Order Form  It has been observed that PGEs generated with Climatology as an input yield noticeable differences statistically during image and spectral analysis  Climatology will continue to be used as the final default if neither of the first two selectable options are available for Ozone and MTP  Users can check the OPERATIONALQUALITYFLAGEXPLANATION field in the metadata or the output file for

Science TeamDocumentationUsing the DataAccess DataCitationRelated ProductsHomepageDataSearch Data CatalogAST_08v003DescriptionThe Terra Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer ASTER Surface Kinetic Temperature AST_08 is generated using the five Thermal Infrared TIR bands acquired either during the day or night time between 8 and 12 µm spectral range It contains surface temperatures at 90 m spatial resolution for the land areas only Surface kinetic temperature provides a vital input to studies of volcanism thermal inertia surface energy and highresolution mapping of fires This product is derived using the same algorithm as the ASTER Surface Emissivity AST_05 ProductSurface kinetic temperature is determined by applying <NAME> using the emissivity values from the TemperatureEmissivity Separation TES algorithm which uses atmospherically corrected ASTER surface radiance TIR data The TES algorithm first estimates emissivity in the TIR channels using the Normalized Emissivity Method NEM These estimates are used along with <NAME> to account for the landleaving TIR radiance that is due to sky irradiance That figure is subtracted from TIR radiance iteratively to estimate the emitted radiance from which temperature is calculated using the NEM moduleThe ASTER L2 Surface Kinetic Temperature data product is only available through NASAs Earthdata Search The ASTER Order Instructions provide stepbystep directions for ordering this productread moreCharacteristicsImprovementsChanges from Previous VersionsThe Science Scalable Scriptsbased Science Processor for Missions S4PM Version 34 algorithm has additional input data options that provide better input data coverage simultaneously acquired MODIS data versus 6hourly modeled NCEP input data and consequently more accurate Level 2 output data The updated algorithm includes the following improvementsA new option has been added to use MODIS Version 61 MOD07_L2 Temperature Water Vapor and Pressure inputs The default order option will remain as National Centers for Environmental Prediction NCEPGlobal Data Assimilation System GDASThe default for the Ozone input data was switched from NCEPTelevision Infrared Observation Satellite TIROS Operational Vertical Sounder TOVS to the new Total Ozone Analysis using Solar Backscatter UltraViolet Version 2 SBUV2 and TOVS TOASTEarth ProbeTotal Ozone Mapping Spectrometer EPTOMS optionThe Level 2 algorithm has been updated to provide a fall back option for the TemperatureWater VaporPressure and Ozone input selections Both selections will automatically revert to the next lower input if the selected input is not availableThe TemperatureWater VaporPressure input will fall back from MOD07 to NCEPGDAS then to ClimatologyThe Ozone input will fall back from TOASTEPTOMS to OZ_DLYTOVS then to ClimatologyStarting June 23 2021 radiometric calibration coefficient Version 5 RCC V5 will be applied to newly observed ASTER data and archived

changes to ASTER PGE Version 34 which will affect all ASTER Level 2 ondemand products  Changes includeAura Ozone Monitoring Instrument OMI has been added as one of the ancillary ozone inputs for any observations made after May 27 2020  The sequence of fallbacks for ozone will remain the sameToolkit has been updated from Version 5217 to 5220  Users may notice minor differences between the two versions  Differences may include minuscule changes in digital numbers around the peripheral of the granule and boundaries of a cloud for Surface Reflectance and Surface Radiance AST07 and AST09 QA Data Plane depending on the Operating System and libraries being used by the user to process the dataAdditionally Climatology which is one of the inputs for Ozone and Moisture Temperature and Pressures MTP will be removed from the Earthdata Order Form  It has been observed that PGEs generated with Climatology as an input yield noticeable differences statistically during image and spectral analysis  Climatology will continue to be used as the final default if neither of the first two selectable options are available for Ozone and MTP  Users can check the

2018 ECOSTRESS experienced an anomaly with its primary mass storage unit MSU ECOSTRESS has a primary and secondary MSU A and B On December 5 2018 the instrument was switched to the secondary MSU and science operations resumed On March 14 2019 the secondary MSU experienced a similar anomaly temporarily halting science acquisitions On May 15 2019 a new data acquisition approach was implemented and science acquisitions resumed To optimize the new acquisition approach TIR bands 2 4 and 5 are being downloaded The data products are as previously except the bands not downloaded contain fill values L1 radiance and L2 emissivity This approach was implemented from May 15 2019 through April 28 2023Data acquisition gap From February 8 to February 16 2020 an ECOSTRESS instrument issue resulted in a data anomaly that created striping in band 4 105 micron These data products have been reprocessed and are available for download No ECOSTRESS data were acquired on February 17 2020 due to the instrument being in SAFEHOLD Data acquired following the anomaly have not been affectedData acquisition ECOSTRESS has now successfully returned to 5band mode after being in 3band mode since 2019 This feature was successfully enabled following a Data Processing Unit firmware update version 41 to the payload on April 28 2023 To better balance contiguous science data scene variables 3band collection is currently being interleaved with 5band acquisitions over the orbital daynight periodsAbout the imageECOSTRESS land surface temperature data from the ECO2LSTE product over Idaho United States

on June 29 2018 and moved to autonomous science operations on August 20 2018 following a successful inorbit checkout period On September 29 2018 ECOSTRESS experienced an anomaly with its primary mass storage unit MSU ECOSTRESS has a primary and secondary MSU A and B On December 5 2018 the instrument was switched to the secondary MSU and science operations resumed On March 14 2019 the secondary MSU experienced a similar anomaly temporarily halting science acquisitions On May 15 2019 a new data acquisition approach was implemented and science acquisitions resumed To optimize the new acquisition approach TIR bands 2 4 and 5 are being downloaded The data products are as previously except the bands not downloaded contain fill values L1 radiance and L2 emissivity This approach was implemented from May 15 2019 through April 28 2023Data acquisition gap From February 8 to February 16 2020 an ECOSTRESS instrument issue resulted in a data anomaly that created striping in band 4 105 micron These data products have been reprocessed and are available for download No ECOSTRESS data were acquired on February 17 2020 due to the instrument being in SAFEHOLD Data acquired following the anomaly have not been affectedData acquisition ECOSTRESS has now successfully returned to 5band mode after being in 3band mode since 2019 This feature was successfully enabled following a Data Processing Unit firmware update version 41 to the payload on April 28 2023 To better balance contiguous science data scene variables 3band collection is currently being interleaved with 5band acquisitions over the

global surface of concentrations micrograms per cubic meter of all composition groundlevel fine particulate matter of 25 micrometers or smaller PM25 for largescale health and environmental researchAbstractThe Global Annual PM25 Grids from MODIS MISR and SeaWiFS Aerosol Optical Depth AOD 19982019 V4GL03 consists of annual concentrations micrograms per cubic meter of all composition groundlevel fine particulate matter PM25 This data set combines AOD retrievals from multiple satellite algorithmsincluding the NASA MODerate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer Collection 61 MODIS C61 Multiangle Imaging SpectroRadiometer Version 23 MISRv23 MODIS MultiAngle Implementation of Atmospheric Correction Collection 6 MAIAC C6 and the SeaViewing Wide FieldofView Sensor SeaWiFS Deep Blue Version 4 The GEOSChem chemical transport model is used to relate this total column measure of aerosol to nearsurface PM25 concentration Geographically Weighted Regression GWR is used with global groundbased measurements from the World Health Organization WHO database to predict and adjust for the residual PM25 bias per grid cell in the initial satellitederived values These estimates are primarily intended to aid in largescale studies Gridded data sets are provided at a resolution of 001 degrees to allow users to agglomerate data as best meets their particular needs Data sets are gridded at the finest resolution of the information sources that were incorporated but do not fully resolve PM25 gradients at the gridded resolution due to influence by information sources at coarser resolution The data are distributed as GeoTIFF files and are in WGS84 projectionRecommended CitationsHammer M S A van Donkelaar C Li A Lyapustin A M Sayer N C Hsu R C Levy M J Garay O V Kalashnikova R

DownloadMapsDocumentationMetadataPurposeTo provide an annual global surface of concentrations micrograms per cubic meter of all composition groundlevel fine particulate matter of 25 micrometers or smaller PM25 for largescale health and environmental researchAbstractThe Global Annual PM25 Grids from MODIS MISR and SeaWiFS Aerosol Optical Depth AOD 19982019 V4GL03 consists of annual concentrations micrograms per cubic meter of all composition groundlevel fine particulate matter PM25 This data set combines AOD retrievals from multiple satellite algorithmsincluding the NASA MODerate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer Collection 61 MODIS C61 Multiangle Imaging SpectroRadiometer Version 23 MISRv23 MODIS MultiAngle Implementation of Atmospheric Correction Collection 6 MAIAC C6 and the SeaViewing Wide FieldofView Sensor SeaWiFS Deep Blue Version 4 The GEOSChem chemical transport model is used to relate this total column measure of aerosol to nearsurface PM25 concentration Geographically Weighted Regression GWR is used with global groundbased measurements from the World Health Organization WHO database to predict and adjust for the residual PM25 bias per grid cell in the initial satellitederived values These estimates are primarily intended to aid in largescale studies Gridded data sets are provided at a resolution of 001 degrees to allow users to agglomerate data as best meets their particular needs Data sets are gridded at the finest resolution of the information sources that were incorporated but do not fully resolve PM25 gradients at the gridded resolution due to influence by information sources at coarser resolution The data are distributed as GeoTIFF files and are in WGS84 projectionRecommended CitationsHammer M S A van Donkelaar C

an annual global surface of concentrations micrograms per cubic meter of mineral dust and seasalt filtered fine particulate matter of 25 micrometers or smaller PM25 for largescale health and environmental researchAbstractThe Global Annual PM25 Grids from MODIS MISR and SeaWiFS Aerosol Optical Depth AOD with GWR 19982016 consist of annual concentrations micrograms per cubic meter of groundlevel fine particulate matter PM25 with dust and seasalt removed This data set combines AOD retrievals from multiple satellite instruments including the NASA Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer MODIS Multiangle Imaging SpectroRadiometer MISR and the SeaViewing Wide FieldofView Sensor SeaWiFS The GEOSChem chemical transport model is used to relate this total column measure of aerosol to nearsurface PM25 concentration Geographically Weighted Regression GWR is used with global groundbased measurements to predict and adjust for the residual PM25 bias per grid cell in the initial satellitederived values These estimates are primarily intended to aid in largescale studies Gridded data sets at 001 degrees are provided to allow users to agglomerate data as best meets their particular needs Data sets are gridded at the finest resolution of the information sources that were incorporated but do not fully resolve PM25 gradients at the gridded resolution due to influence by information sources at coarser resolutions The data are distributed as GeoTIFF files and are in WGS 84 projectionRecommended <NAME> A R V Martin M Brauer N C Hsu R A Kahn R C Levy A Lyapustin A M

The TROPOMI instrument onboard the Copernicus Sentinel5 Precursor is a nadirviewing imaging spectrometer covering wavelength bands between the ultraviolet and the shortwave infrared The instrument uses passive remote sensing techniques to attain its objective by measuring at the Top Of Atmosphere TOA the solar radiation reflected by and radiated from the earthOzone in the tropical troposphere plays various important roles The intense UV radiation and high humidity in the tropics stimulate the formation of the hydroxyl radical OH by the photolysis of ozone OH is the most important oxidant in the troposphere because it reacts with virtually all trace gases such as CO CH4 and other hydrocarbons The tropics are also characterized by large emissions of nitrogen oxides NOx carbon monoxide CO and hydrocarbons both from natural and anthropogenic sources Ozone that is formed over regions where large amounts of these ozone precursors are emitted can be transported over great distances and affects areas far from the sourceThe TROPOMI tropospheric ozone product is a level2c product that represents three day averaged tropospheric ozone columns on a 05 by 1 latitudelongitude grid for the tropical region between 20N and 20S The TROPOMI tropospheric ozone column product uses the TROPOMI Level2 total OZONE and CLOUD products as input Data Set Specifications V2Temporal coverageReprocessed

OzoneTROPOMI Level 2 Tropospheric OzoneL2__O3_TCL The TROPOMI instrument onboard the Copernicus Sentinel5 Precursor is a nadirviewing imaging spectrometer covering wavelength bands between the ultraviolet and the shortwave infrared The instrument uses passive remote sensing techniques to attain its objective by measuring at the Top Of Atmosphere TOA the solar radiation reflected by and radiated from the earthOzone in the tropical troposphere plays various important roles The intense UV radiation and high humidity in the tropics stimulate the formation of the hydroxyl radical OH by the photolysis of ozone OH is the most important oxidant in the troposphere because it reacts with virtually all trace gases such as CO CH4 and other hydrocarbons The tropics are also characterized by large emissions of nitrogen oxides NOx carbon monoxide CO and hydrocarbons both from natural and anthropogenic sources Ozone that is formed over regions where large amounts of these ozone precursors are emitted can be transported over great distances and affects areas far from the sourceThe TROPOMI tropospheric ozone product is a level2c product that represents three day averaged tropospheric ozone columns on a 05 by 1 latitudelongitude grid for the tropical region between 20N and 20S The TROPOMI tropospheric ozone column product uses the TROPOMI Level2 total OZONE and CLOUD products as

Function and Albedo BRDFAlbedo 30 arc second Global GapFilled SnowFree MCD43GF Version 6  is derived from the 30 arc second Climate Modeling Grid CMG MCD43D Version 6 product suite with additional processing to provide a gapfilled snowfree product The highest quality full inversion values were used for the temporal fitting effort and supplemented with lower quality pixels spatial fitting and spatial smoothing as needed The status of each pixel can be found in the quality layer for each band To generate a snowfree product pixels with ephemeral snow were removed using the MCD43D41 snow flags The underlying MCD43D utilizes a BRDF model derived from all available high quality cloud clear reflectance data over a 16 day moving window centered on and emphasizing the daily day of interest the ninth day of each retrieval period as reflected in the Julian date in the filename This 30 arc second BRDF model is then used to produce the Albedo and NBAR products MCD43D These BRDF model parameters are computed for MODIS spectral bands 1 through 7 047 um 055 um 067 um 086 um 124 um 164 um 21 um as well as the shortwave infrared band 0350 um visible band 0307 um and nearinfrared 0750

clearsky observations within the 1000 m grid as opposed to aggregating from the 500 m albedoProduct MaturityValidation at stage 3 has been achieved for all MODIS BRDFAlbedo products Further details

extensionKnown IssuesThere is an error in the DataFieldName value in the metadata This affects bands 27 for the years 20002004 and 2013The incorrect representation of the aerosol quantities low average high in the C6 MYD09 and MOD09 surface reflectance products may have impacted downstream products particularly over arid bright surfaces This and a few other issues have been corrected for C61 Therefore users should avoid substantive use of the C6 MCD43 products and wait for the C61 products In any event users are always strongly encouraged to download and use the extensive QA data provided in MCD43A2 in addition to the briefer mandatory QAs provided as part of the MCD43A1 3 and 4 productsFor complete information about the MCD43GF known issues refer to the MODIS Land Quality Assessment

spatial fitting and spatial smoothing as needed The status of each pixel can be found in the quality layer for each band To generate a snowfree product pixels with ephemeral snow were removed using the MCD43D41 snow flags The underlying MCD43D utilizes a BRDF model derived from all available high quality cloud clear reflectance data over a 16 day moving window centered on and emphasizing the daily day of interest the ninth day of each retrieval period as reflected in the Julian date in the filename This 30 arc second BRDF model is then used to produce the Albedo and NBAR products MCD43D These BRDF model parameters are computed for MODIS spectral bands 1 through 7 047 um 055 um 067 um 086 um 124 um 164 um 21 um as well as the shortwave infrared band 0350 um visible band 0307 um and nearinfrared 0750 um broad bandsThe MCD43GF product includes 67 layers containing blacksky albedo BSA at local solar noon isotropic model parameter ISO volumetric model parameter VOL geometric model parameter GEO quality QA Nadir BRDFAdjusted Reflectance NBAR at local solar noon and whitesky albedo WSA Due to the large file size each data layer is distributed as a separate HDF file Users are encouraged to download the quality layers for each of the 10 bands to check quality assessment information before using the BRDFAlbedo dataThe MCD43 product is not recommended for solar zenith angles beyond 70 degreesUsers are urged to use the band specific quality flags to isolate the highest quality full inversion results for their own science applications as described in the User GuideVersion 61 reprocessing will begin in late 2023 In the reprocessing the QA values for the MCD43GF product will change to reflect the band 5 and 6 dead detector issuesread moreCharacteristicsImprovementsChanges from Previous VersionsObservations are weighted to estimate the BRDFAlbedo on the ninth day of the 16day periodMCD43 products use the snow status weighted to the ninth day instead of the majority snownosnow observations from the 16day periodBetter quality at high latitudes from use of all available observations for the acquisition period Collection 5 used only four observations per dayThe MCD43 products use L2Glite surface reflectance as inputIn cases where insufficient highquality reflectances are obtained a database with archetypal BRDF parameters is used to supplement the observational data and perform a lower quality magnitude inversion This database is continually updated with the latest full inversion retrieval for each pixelCMG Albedo is estimated using all the clearsky observations within the 1000 m grid as opposed to aggregating from the 500 m albedoProduct MaturityValidation at stage 3 has been achieved for all MODIS BRDFAlbedo products
