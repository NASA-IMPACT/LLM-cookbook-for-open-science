        "Description": "The Global Mean Sea Level Trend dataset contains the Global Mean Sea Level (GMSL) trend generated from the Integrated Multi-Mission Ocean Altimeter Data for Climate Research. The GMSL trend is a 1-dimensional time series of globally averaged Sea Surface Height Anomalies (SSHA) from TOPEX/Poseidon, Jason-1, OSTM/Jason-2, and Jason-3 that covers September 1992 to present with a lag of up to 4 months. The data are reported as variations relative to a 20-year TOPEX/Jason collinear mean. Bias adjustments and cross-calibrations were applied to ensure SSHA data are consistent across the missions. Glacial Isostatic Adjustment (GIA) was also applied. The data are available as a table in ASCII format.",
