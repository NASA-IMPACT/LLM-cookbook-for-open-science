The NRPI covers 135 countries and is calculated based on the weighted average percentage of biomes under protected status. The CHI is a composite index for 194 countries derived from the average of three proximity-to-target scores for access to at least basic water and sanitation, along with child mortality. The dataset includes a consistent time series of NRPI scores for 2017 to 2021 and CHI scores for 2010 to 2020.",

The DPI for each sector represents land suitability that accounts for both resource potential and development feasibility. Each DPI is a 1km spatially-explicit global land suitability map that has been validated using locations of current and planned development and examined for uncertainty and sensitivity. The DPIs can be used to identify lands with current favorable economic and physical conditions for individual sector expansion and assist in planning for sector and cumulative development across the globe.",
