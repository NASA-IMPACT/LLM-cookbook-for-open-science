The web app mashes up layers from various sources, including SEDAC, NASA LANCE, NASA GIBS, USGS, NOAA, ESRI, and others. The population count data for 2015 can be visualized as a map layer in the Hazards Mapper. The population estimates are obtained using SEDAC Population Estimation Service (PES), which is an OGC compliant Web Processing Service (WPS).",
