These predictions incorporated various predictor variables such as Ozone (O3) ground measurements from the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Air Quality System (AQS) monitoring data, land-use variables, meteorological variables, chemical transport models, and remote sensing data, along with other data sources. After imputing missing data with machine learning algorithms, a geographically weighted ensemble model was applied that combined estimates from three types of machine learners: neural network, random forest, and gradient boosting. The annual predictions were computed by averaging the daily 8-hour maximum predictions in each year for each grid cell. The results demonstrate high overall model performance with a cross-validated R-squared value against daily observations of 0.90 and 0.86 for annual averages.",
