        "Description": "The Famine Early Warning Systems Network (FEWS NET) is a leading provider of early warning and analysis on acute food insecurity around the world. The FEWS NET - Acute Food Insecurity Data dataset provides information on acute food insecurity, which refers to rapid-onset or short-term food insecurity of an extent that merits emergency response. The severity of acute food insecurity is defined by assessing the degree to which households can meet basic survival needs and maintain normal livelihoods. The dataset includes the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC) phases, which represent FEWS NET's analysis of the most likely acute food insecurity outcomes for near-term (4 months into the future) and medium-term (8 months into the future) projection periods. The dataset also includes FEWS NET classifications, which are IPC-compatible. IPC-compatible analysis follow all IPC methodological protocols but do not necessarily reflect the consensus of national food security partners. The dataset covers countries in Africa, Central America, and the Middle East and Asia. It is available in geotiff format. ",
