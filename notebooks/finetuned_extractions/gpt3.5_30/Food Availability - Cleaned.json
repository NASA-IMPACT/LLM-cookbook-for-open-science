The database was generated from a Google Scholar search followed by a manual examination of the results for papers that made substantial use of the SSPs. Each paper was then coded along a number of different dimensions, including categories of types of papers or analysis, number of subcategories for SSP Applications and SSP Extensions, particular Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs) used, particular Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs) used, and particular SSP-RCP combinations used.",
