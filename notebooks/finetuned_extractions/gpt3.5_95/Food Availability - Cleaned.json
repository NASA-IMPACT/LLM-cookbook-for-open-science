GRDIv1 is built from socio-demographic and satellite data inputs that were spatially harmonized, indexed, and weighted into six main components to produce the final index raster. Inputs were selected from the best-available data that either continuously vary across space or have at least administrative level 1 (provincial/state) resolution and which have global spatial coverage.",
