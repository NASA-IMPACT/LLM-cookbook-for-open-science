The VIIRS Aerosol NRT product is a Level-2 product, generated at 6 km, at nadir spatial resolution. The DB and SOAR algorithms use combinations of VIIRS's reflective solar bands to provide information about the loading and size/type of aerosol particles in the atmosphere. Radiometrically-accurate radiances are required, as are cloud-free, snow-free daytime scenes; thus, gaps in the aerosol data will appear wherever these conditions are not met.",
