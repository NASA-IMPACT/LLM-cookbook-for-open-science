The INFORM Global Risk Index (GRI) model is based on risk concepts published in the scientific literature and envisages three dimensions of risk: Hazard, Exposure, Vulnerability, and Lack of Coping Capacity. The INFORM GRI model is split into different levels to provide a quick overview of the underlying factors leading to humanitarian risk. The INFORM GRI model supports a proactive crisis management framework and will be helpful for an objective allocation of resources for disaster management as well as for coordinated actions focused on anticipating, mitigating, and preparing for humanitarian emergencies. Only the two main sections, Vulnerability and Lack of Coping Capacity, not the Hazard & Exposure section, were used in the IPCC AR6.",
