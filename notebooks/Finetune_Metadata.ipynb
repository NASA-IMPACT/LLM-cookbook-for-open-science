Hurricane Maria Puerto Ricos lights went outIn the days weeks and months that followed research physical scientist Miguel Román at NASAs Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt Maryland and his colleagues combined NASAs Black Marble night lights data product from the NASANOAA Suomi National Polarorbiting Partnership satellite with USGSNASA Landsat data and Googles OpenStreetMap to develop a neighborhoodscale map of energy use in communities across Puerto Rico as the electricity grid was slowly restored They then analyzed the relationship between restoration rates in terms of days without electricity and the remoteness of communities from major citiesThis visualization starts with a global view of hurricane Maria hitting Puerto Rico  We then zoom in to Puerto Rico to compare the standard night lights dataset to a new high definition version of nights lights  After the hurricane passes over the island we see a massive drop in night light intensity due to loss of power After showing night light levels over several stages of hurricane recovery we transition to a Days Without Power dataset  The camera then zooms in to several locations around the island to examine each

Proportional Economic Loss Risk Deciles is a 25 minute grid of cyclone hazard economic loss as proportions of Gross Domestic Product GDP per analytical unit Estimates of GDP at risk are based on regional economic loss rates derived from historical records of the Emergency Events Database EMDAT Loss rates are weighted by the hazards frequency and distribution The methodology of Sachs et al 2003 is followed to determine baseline estimates of GDP per grid cell To better reflect the confidence surrounding the data and procedures the range of proportionalities is classified into deciles 10 class of an approximately equal number of grid cells of increasing risk This data set is the result of collaboration among the Columbia University Center for Hazards and Risk Research CHRR

FriedlDocumentationUsing the DataAccess DataCitationRelated ProductsHomepageDataSearch Data CatalogMSLSP30NAv011DescriptionThe MultiSource Land Surface Phenology LSP Yearly North America 30 meter m Version 11 product MSLSP provides a Land Surface Phenology product for North America derived from Harmonized Landsat Sentinel2 HLS data Data from the combined Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager OLI and Sentinel2A and 2B Multispectral Instrument MSI provides the user community with dates of phenophase transitions including the timing of greenup maturity senescence and dormancy at 30 meter spatial resolution These data sets are useful for a wide range of applications including ecosystem and agroecosystem modeling monitoring the response of terrestrial ecosystems to climate variability and extreme events croptype discrimination and land cover land use and land cover change mappingProvided in the MSLSP product are layers for percent greenness onset greenness dates Enhanced Vegetative Index EVI2 amplitude and maximum EVI2 and data quality information for up to two phenological cycles per year For areas where the data values are missing due to cloud cover or other reasons the data gaps are filled with good quality values from the year directly preceding or following the product year A low resolution browse image representing maximum EVI is also available for each MSLSP30NA granuleread moreCharacteristicsImprovementsChanges from Previous VersionsModest changes were made to the spline fitting algorithm used to estimate the MSLSP30NA product in V011  Only gaps greater than 20 days were filled using observations from the outside of the target year to reduce the computational burden Sensitivity analyses demonstrated that this change had negligible impact on product resultsThe Quality Assurance QA fields were updated to reflect the changes in the gapfilling Version 1 included QA values from 17 whereas Version 11 includes QA values from 16 9 and 10Peak date

2013Set OverviewData DownloadMapsMap ServicesDocumentationMetadataPurposeTo provide a global data set of average summer daytime maximumnighttime minimum land surface temperatures LSTs for urban extents as well as the LST difference between the urban area and the bufferAbstractThe Urban Heat Island UHI effect represents the relatively higher temperatures found in urban areas compared to surrounding rural areas owing to higher proportions of impervious surfaces and the release of waste heat from vehicles and heating and cooling systems Paved surfaces and built structures tend to absorb shortwave radiation from the sun and release longwave radiation after a lag of a few hours The Global Urban Heat Island UHI Data Set 2013 estimates the land surface temperature within urban areas in degrees Celsius average summer daytime maximum and average summer nighttime minimum as well as the difference between those temperatures and the temperatures in surrounding rural areas defined as a 10km buffer around the urban extent Urban extents are from SEDACs Global RuralUrban Mapping Project Version 1 GRUMPv1 and land surface temperatures are from SEDACs Global Summer Land

NameTELLUS_GRACGRFO_MASCON_CRI_GRID_RL061_V3DescriptionThis dataset contains gridded monthly global water storageheight anomalies relative to a timemean derived from GRACE and GRACEFO and processed at JPL using the Mascon approach RL061Mv03 This version of the data employs a Coastal Resolution Improvement CRI filter that reduces signal leakage errors across coastlines These data are provided in a single data file in netCDF format and can be used for analysis for ocean ice and hydrology phenomena The water storageheight anomalies are given in equivalent water thickness units cm The solution provided here is derived from solving for monthly gravity field variations in terms of geolocated spherical cap mass concentration functions rather than global spherical harmonic coefficients Additionally realistic geophysical information is introduced during the solution inversion to intrinsically remove correlated error Thus these Mascon grids do not need to be destriped or smoothed like traditional spherical harmonic gravity solutions The complete Mascon solution consists of 4551 relatively independent estimates of surface mass change that have been derived using an equalarea 3degree grid of individual mascons A subset of these individual mascons span coastlines and contain mixed land and ocean mass change signals In a postprocessing step the CRI filter is applied to those mixed landocean Mascons to separate land and ocean mass The land mask used to perform this separation is provided in the same directory as this dataset Since the individual mascons act as an inherent smoother on the gravity field a set of optional gain factors for continental hydrology applications that can be applied to the solution to study mass change signals at submascon resolution is also provided within the same data directory as the Mascon data This RL061Mv03 is an updated version of the previous Tellus JPL Mascon RL06Mv02 DOI 105067TEMSC3JC62 RL061Mv03 differs from RL06Mv02 only in the Level1B accelerometer transplant data that is used for the GF2 GRACEFO 2 satellite RL061Mv03 uses the ACH data product For more information please visit

changes mass changes of the Greenland and Antarctic Ice Sheet and terrestrial water storage changes The glacier ice sheet and terrestrial water storage are estimated by combining GRACE observations 20032018 with longterm estimates from insitu observations and models Steric estimates are based on insitu temperature profiles The upper and lower bound represent the 5 and 95 percent confidence level The numbers are equal to the ones presented in Frederikse et al The causes of sealevel rise since 1900 Nature 2020This dataset was produced by the Heat and Ocean Mass from Gravity ESDR HOMAGE project with funding from MeASUREs2017 HOMAGE is combining satellite observations to create a set of ESDRs that provide a homogeneous basis for accurate and current quantification of the planetary sea level

intercalibrate merge and interpolate all satellite microwave precipitation estimates together with microwavecalibrated infrared IR satellite estimates precipitation gauge analyses and potentially other precipitation estimators at fine time and space scales for the TRMM and GPM eras over the entire globe\\xa0The system is run several times for each observation time first giving a quick estimate IMERG Early Run and successively providing better estimates as more data arrive IMERG Late Run The final step uses monthly gauge data to create researchlevel products IMERG Final RunThe main differences between the IMERG Early and Late Run areThe halfhourly Final Run product uses a monthtomonth adjustment to the monthly Final Run product which combines the multisatellite data for the month with GPCC\\xa0gauge analysis\\xa0The adjustment within the month in each half hour is a ratio multiplier thats fixed for the month but spatially varyingThe Late Run is computed about 14\\xa0hours after observation time so sometimes a microwave overpass is not delivered in time for the Late Run but subsequently comes in and can be used in the Final \\xa0This would affect both the half hour in which the overpass occurs and potentially morphed values in nearby half hoursWe always advise people to use the Final Run for research unless their application will require the use of Early or Late data due to latency In such a case the application should be developed using the longrecord of the Early or Late as appropriate The vast majority of grid boxes have fairly similar Late and Final values over ocean and to a lesser extent over land Extreme value statistics are more sensitive to these details medians means and rootmean square difference are less sensitive\\xa0NotesIMERG

PROverview The GPM Combined RadarRadiometer Algorithm performs two basic functions first it provides in principle the most accurate high resolution estimates of surface rainfall rate and precipitation vertical distributions that can be achieved from a spaceborne platform and it is therefore valuable for applications where information regarding instantaneous storm structure are vital Second a global representative collection of combined algorithm estimates will yield a single common reference dataset that can be used to crosscalibrate rain rate estimates from all of the passive microwave radiometers in the GPM constellation The crosscalibration of radiometer estimates is crucial for developing a consistent high timeresolution precipitation record for climate science and prediction

vertical distributions that can be achieved from a spaceborne platform and it is therefore valuable for applications where information regarding instantaneous storm structure are vital Second a global representative collection of combined algorithm estimates will yield a single common reference dataset that can be used to crosscalibrate rain rate estimates from all of the passive microwave radiometers in the GPM constellation The crosscalibration of radiometer estimates is crucial for developing a consistent high timeresolution precipitation record for climate science and prediction

Dualfrequency Precipitation Radar DPR and TRMM Precipitation Radar PR singleorbit rainfall estimates\\xa0The objective of these radar algorithms is to generate f radaronly derived meteorological quantities on an instantaneous FOV field of view basis working from the level 1 radar products A subset of these estimates serves as input data to the level 2 combined radarradiometer algorithm and the level 3 combined and radaronly products The general idea behind these level 2 algorithms is to determine general characteristics of the precipitation correct for attenuation and estimate profiles of the precipitation water content rainfall rate When dualwavelength data are available the algorithm also estimates the particle size distributions in the phase of the precipitation ie liquid or frozen GPMs dualwavelength data will provide better estimates of rainfall and snowfall rates than those of the TRMM PR data\\xa0Current Algorithm Version V07BDates Covered April 2014  Present DPR
