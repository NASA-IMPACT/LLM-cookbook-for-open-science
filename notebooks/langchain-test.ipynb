Only about 20 land tiles fall into this category. Figure 2. The observed mean solar zenith angle in each tiled Sentinel-2 and Landsat-8 image and the solar zenith angle used in each image's BRDF normalization, for an equatorial tile 19NGA in 2019. The observed mean solar zenith angle in a Landsat image is higher than that in a temporally close Sentile-2 image because Landsat overpasses 30 minutes earlier. There is also day-to-day oscillation in mean observed solar zenith angle for each sensor due to the alternating observation from two adjacent orbits. 4.5 Bandpass adjustment MSI and OLI have slightly different bandpasses for equivalent spectral bands, and these differences need to be removed in HLS products. The OLI spectral bandpasses are used as reference, to which the MSI spectral bands are adjusted. The bandpass adjustment is a linear fit between equivalent spectral bands. The slope and offset coefficients were computed based on 500 hyperspectral spectra selected on 160 globally distributed Hyperion scenes processed to surface reflectance and used to synthesis MSI and OLI bands. MSI's RSRs correspond to the version v2.0 (Claverie et al., 2018). The spectral differences between MSI onboard Sentinel-2A 10 (S2A) and Sentinel-2B (S2B) are accounted. Note that the S2A CA and Blue bands RSRs correspond to S2B RSRs. The coefficients are given in Table 5, and scatterplots are given in Figure 3 and Figure 4. Figure 3: Sentinel-2A MSI vs OLI surface reflectance for the seven equivalent bands, using a synthetic dataset built with 500 surface reflectance spectra from Hyperion.

With the improved geolocation in the Collection-2 Landsat-8 data, AROP-based temporal co-registration has phased out. But spatial resampling of Landsat-8 data is still needed in gridding the data into the MGRS tiles used by Sentinel-2, because even if the Landsat image and the intended MGRS tile are in the same UTM zone, ESA registers a corner of a Sentinel-2 pixel to the UTM coordinate origin, but USGS registers the center of a Landsat pixel to the UTM coordinate origin. A simple coordinate shift will not work. Moreover, when the Landsat data and the MGRS tile are in different UTM zones, reprojection and resampling must always be performed. Spectral data resampling in S30 creation uses the simple area-weighted average because of the nesting relationship between the original 10 m, 20 m, 60 m input pixels and the desired output 30 m pixels. To produce an S30 pixel, a set of 3x3 10 m pixels are averaged with equal weights, 2x2 20 m pixels are averaged with weights 4/9, 2/9, 2/9, and 1/9 depending on the relative position, and a 60 m pixel is duplicated to produce 2x2 S30 pixels. To create S30 from Sentinel-2 L1C input of processing baseline prior to 2.04 (approximately mid-2016), additional resampling is needed, before the area-weighted average, as part of the AROP-based temporal co-registration. Once LaSRC derives the surface reflectance, cubic convolution is applied to resample the 10 m/20 m/60 m spectral bands based on AROP-derived coordinate transform. Then the aera-weighted average described above is applied. Only a small proportion of L1C images are of processing baseline prior to 2.04. Resampling of the QA layer is implemented differently. The QA layer is mostly based on cloud masking by Fmask, which outputs at 30 m over the WRS-2 path-row grid for Landsat and at 20 m over the MGRS grid for Sentinel-2. It also incorporates the qualitative aerosol optical thickness level assessment from the atmospheric correction. The resample of the QA is performed for each bit of the QA byte in turn: - L30: while a 4x4 window is used in cubic convolution resampling of the spectral data, only the innermost 2x2 pixels are examined for QA resampling because 1) almost all the cubic convolution weights are in the 2x2 window, 2) a 4x4 window would artificially create a mixture situation. The \"presence\" rule is used: a QA bit value 1 in any of the 4 input pix\n",
