tidegauge observations and uses the virtualstation method to aggregate the individual observations into a global estimate The contributing processes consist of thermosteric changes glacier mass changes mass changes of the Greenland and Antarctic Ice Sheet and terrestrial water storage changes The glacier ice sheet and terrestrial water storage are estimated by combining GRACE observations

First, for each of the considered hazards (cyclones, droughts, earthquakes, floods, landslides, and volcanoes), subnational distributions of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) are computed using a methodology developed from Sachs et al.

World Bank Development Indicators are substituted for GDP estimates of varied origin and the subnational GDP is estimated using the fore mentioned contribution ratios. A subnational, per capita GDP is derived and a final GDP estimate per grid cell is made based on grid cell population density. A raw, total economic loss is computed per grid cell using a regional economic loss rate derived from EM-DAT records. To more accurately reflect the confidence surrounding the economic loss estimate, the range of losses are classified into deciles, 10 classes of an approximately equal number of grid cells.

SRTM’s primary focus was to generate a near-global DEM of the Earth using radar interferometry. It was a primary component of the payload on space shuttle Endeavour during its STS-99 mission, which was launched on February 11, 2000, and ﬂew for 11 days. In addition to Terra Advanced Spaceborne Thermal and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER) Global Digital Elevation Model (GDEM) Version 2 data, NASADEM also relied on Ice, Cloud, and Land Elevation Satellite (ICESat) Geoscience Laser Altimeter System (GLAS) ground control points of its lidar shots to improve surface elevation measurements that led to improved geolocation accuracy. Other reprocessing improvements include the conversion to geoid reference and the use of GDEMs and Advanced Land Observing Satellite Panchromatic Remote-sensing instrument for Stereo Mapping (PRISM) AW3D30 DEM, and interpolation for void filling. NASADEM are distributed in 1 degree latitude by 1 degree longitude tiles and consist of all land between 60° N and 56° S latitude. This accounts for about 80% of Earth’s total landmass.',\n",

Because of the lack of globally consistent data on migration, indirect estimation methods were used. The authors relied on a combination of data on spatial population distribution for four time slices (1970, 1980, 1990, and 2000) and subnational rates of natural increase in order to derive estimates of net migration on a 30 arc-second (~1km) grid cell basis. Net migration was estimated by subtracting the population in time period 2 from the population in time period 1, and then subtracting the natural increase (births minus deaths). The residual was considered to be net migration (in-migrants minus out-migrants). The authors ran 13 geospatial net migration estimation models based on outputs from the same number of imputation runs for urban and rural rates of natural increase.This data set represents the average of those runs. These data are reliable at broad scales of analysis (e.g. ecosystems or regions), but are generally not reliable for local level analyses.

Urban extreme heat events and urban population exposure are identified for each urban settlement in the data record for five combined temperature-humidity thresholds: two-day or longer periods where the daily maximum Heat Index (HImax) > 40.6 °C; one-day or longer periods where HImax > 46.1 °C; and one day or longer periods where the daily maximum Wet Bulb Globe Temperature (WBGTmax) > 28 °C, 30 °C, and 32 °C. The WBGTmax thresholds follow the International Standards Organization (ISO) criteria for risk of occupational heat related heat illness, whereas the HImax thresholds follow the U.S. National Weather Services' definition for an excessive heat warning. For each criteria, across urban settlements worldwide, the data set also contains the duration, intensity, and severity of each urban extreme heat event.\",\n",

Paved surfaces and built structures tend to absorb shortwave radiation from the sun and release long-wave radiation after a lag of a few hours. The Global Urban Heat Island (UHI) Data Set, 2013, estimates the land surface temperature within urban areas in degrees Celsius (average summer daytime maximum and average summer nighttime minimum) as well as the difference between those temperatures and the temperatures in surrounding rural areas, defined as a 10km buffer around the urban extent. Urban extents are from SEDAC?s Global Rural-Urban Mapping Project, Version 1 (GRUMPv1), and land surface temperatures are from SEDAC?s Global Summer Land Surface Temperature (LST) Grids, 2013, which are derived from the Aqua Level-3 Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Version 5 global daytime and nighttime Land Surface Temperature (LST) 8-day composite data (MYD11A2). For most regions, the UHI data set provides the average daytime maximum (1:30 p.m. overpass) and average nighttime minimum (1:30 a.m. overpass) temperatures in urban and rural areas, and the urban-rural temperature differences, derived from LST data representing a 40-day time-span during July-August (Julian days 185-224) in the northern hemisphere and January-February (Julian days 001-040) in the southern hemisphere. LST grid cells with missing values resulting from high cloud cover in tropical regions were filled with daytime maximum and nighttime minimum LST values from April-May 2013 in the northern hemisphere and December 2013-January 2014 in the southern hemisphere, where available.

The GMIS dataset consists of two components: 1) global percent of impervious cover; and 2) per-pixel associated uncertainty for the global impervious cover. These layers are co-registered to the same spatial extent at a common 30m spatial resolution. The spatial extent covers the entire globe except Antarctica and some small islands. This dataset is one of the first global, 30m datasets of man-made impervious cover to be derived from the GLS data for 2010 and is a companion dataset to the Global Human Built-up And Settlement Extent (HBASE) dataset. The dataset is expected to have a rather broad spectrum of users, from those wishing to examine/study the fine details of urban land cover over the globe at full 30m resolution to global modelers trying to understand the climate/environmental impacts of man-made surfaces at continental to global scales. For example, the data are applicable to local modeling studies of urban impacts on the energy, water, and carbon cycles, as well as analyses at the individual country level.',\n",

NameMERGED_TP_J1_OSTM_OST_GMSL_ASCII_V51DescriptionThis dataset contains the Global Mean Sea Level GMSL trend generated from the Integrated MultiMission Ocean Altimeter Data for Climate Research Version 51 The GMSL trend is a 1dimensional time series of globally averaged Sea Surface Height Anomalies SSHA from TOPEXPoseidon Jason1 OSTMJason2 and Jason3 that covers September 1992 to present with a lag of up to 4 months The data are reported as variations relative to a 20year TOPEXJason collinear mean Bias adjustments and crosscalibrations were applied to ensure SSHA data are consistent across the missions Glacial Isostatic Adjustment GIA was also applied The data are available as a table in ASCII format Changes between the version 42 and version 5x releases are described in detail

Ocean Altimeter Data for Climate Research Version 51 The GMSL trend is a 1dimensional time series of globally averaged Sea Surface Height Anomalies SSHA from TOPEXPoseidon Jason1 OSTMJason2 and Jason3 that covers September 1992 to present with a lag of up to 4 months The data are reported as variations relative to a 20year TOPEXJason collinear mean Bias adjustments and crosscalibrations were applied to ensure SSHA data are consistent across the missions Glacial Isostatic Adjustment GIA was also applied The data are available as a table in ASCII format Changes between the version 42 and
