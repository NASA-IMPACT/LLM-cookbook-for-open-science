Methods: We measured the bystander response to 1Gy a-particle radiation in Mrad9-/- mouse stem cells and H1299shRAD9 cells, using chromosomal aberration and micronucleus formation as DNA damage endpoints. In the H1299 model we used whole genome microarray analyses to profile the transcriptome of irradiated and bystander cells. Results: We investigated the role of RAD9 in the bystander response and showed that depletion or mutation of RAD9 had an effect of increasing chromosomal structural damage as well as micronucleus formation in bystander cells. The enhancement of the damage effect correlated strongly with a transcriptomic response in critical pathways. RAD9 depletion affected many pathways in the cell, including the UV-MAPK pathway, involving p38MAPK members, STAT1 and PARP1 at the mRNA levels. There was an overall reduction of RNA biogenesis of gene members of this pathway suggesting that perhaps these signaling pathways do not function optimally after RAD9 depletion. Using network analysis we found there may be differential activation of transcriptional regulators between the irradiated and bystander cells involving the SP1 and NUPR1 transcription factors. Network analysis also suggested that HIF1a (Hypoxia induced factor 1a) activation could be a negative predictor of the bystander effect and perhaps that local hypoxic stress observed by cells that are directly exposed to radiation may predict whether or not they will elicit a bystander response. Gene expression in H1299 cells was measured at 4 hours after exposure to 1 Gy a-particles. There were two groups based on RAD9 status, RAD9 normal and RAD9 depleted by siRNA.

The mechanism of radiation response includes inter-cellular signaling and intra-cellular communication by which the bystander signal is propagated. Methods: We measured the bystander response to 1Gy a-particle radiation in Mrad9-/- mouse stem cells and H1299shRAD9 cells, using chromosomal aberration and micronucleus formation as DNA damage endpoints. In the H1299 model we used whole genome microarray analyses to profile the transcriptome of irradiated and bystander cells. Results: We investigated the role of RAD9 in the bystander response and showed that depletion or mutation of RAD9 had an effect of increasing chromosomal structural damage as well as micronucleus formation in bystander cells. The enhancement of the damage effect correlated strongly with a transcriptomic response in critical pathways. RAD9 depletion affected many pathways in the cell, including the UV-MAPK pathway, involving p38MAPK members, STAT1 and PARP1 at the mRNA levels. There was an overall reduction of RNA biogenesis of gene members of this pathway suggesting that perhaps these signaling pathways do not function optimally after RAD9 depletion. Using network analysis we found there may be differential activation of transcriptional regulators between the irradiated and bystander cells involving the SP1 and NUPR1 transcription factors. Network analysis also suggested that HIF1a (Hypoxia induced factor 1a) activation could be a negative predictor of the bystander effect and perhaps that local hypoxic stress observed by cells that are directly exposed to radiation may predict whether or not they will elicit a bystander response. Gene expression in H1299 cells was measured at 4 hours after exposure to 1 Gy a-particles. There were two groups based on RAD9 status, RAD9 normal and RAD9 depleted by siRNA. In each of these groups, sham irradiated, direct irradiated cells for positive bystanders, positive bystanders, direct irradiated cells for negative bystanders and negative bystanders; were identified based on micronucleus responses. Five biological replicates were analyzed for each experimental group.",The use of network analysis allowed the discovery of potential variations in the activation of transcription factors between directly irradiated cells and indirectly affected cells.,131561

However, hydrated magnesium sulfate mineral levels in the regolith of Mars can reach as high as 10 wt%, and would be expected to be highly inhibitory to plant growth. A global approach was used to identify novel genes with potential to enhance tolerance to high MgSO4 stress. The early Arabidopsis root transcriptome response to elevated concentrations of magnesium sulfate was characterized in col-0, and also between col-0 and the mutant line cax1-1 – a mutant relatively tolerant of high levels of MgSO4•7H2O in soil solution.","The cax1-1 mutant line demonstrated relative tolerance to elevated levels of MgSO4•7H2O in solution, contrasted with the standard col-0 line.",53981711

Here, we extended these studies to determine the structural and functional skeletal alterations in 14-week-old male Wister rats exposed to 20%, 40%, 70%, or 100% of body weight for 1, 2, or 4 weeks (n equals 11–12/group). Using in vivo pQCT, we found that trabecular bone density at the proximal tibia declined in proportion to the degree of unloading and continued progressively with time, without evidence of a plateau by 4 weeks. Ex vivo measurements of trabecular microarchitecture in the distal femur by microcomputed tomography revealed deficits in bone volume fraction, 2 and 4 weeks after unloading. Histologic analyses of trabecular bone in the distal femur revealed the decreased osteoblast number and mineralizing surface in unloaded rats. Three-point bending of the femoral diaphysis indicated modest or no reductions in femoral stiffness and estimated modulus due to PWB. Our results suggest that this rat model of PWB leads to trabecular bone deterioration that is progressive and generally proportional to the degree of PWB, with minimal effects on cortical bone.

Comparing host irradiation in the context of TGFB levels showed that inflammation was robustly associated with claudin-low tumors. The association of the irradiated host metaprofiles with estrogen receptor negative status and claudin-low subtype suggests that host processes similar to those induced by radiation underlie sporadic cancers.

IgM repertoire resolved?,"Immune dysregulation is among the main adverse outcomes of spaceflight. Despite its crucial role in host protection, effects on the human antibody repertoire are unknown. Consequently, we examined the IgM repertoire of five cosmonauts 25 days before launch, after 64 and 129 days spent on the International Space Station (ISS), and after 1, 7 and 30 days of Earth reambulation using high-throughput sequencing. This is the first study of this kind. Our data revealed that the IgM repertoire of cosmonauts was different from the one of control subjects already prior to launch, and that 2 out the 5 analyzed cosmonauts presented significant changes of their IgM repertoire during the mission. These modifications persisted up to 30 days after landing, likely affected the specificities of IgM binding sites, correlated with changes of the V(D)J recombination process in charge of creating functional antibody genes, and coincided with a higher stress response. These data confirm that about half of the astronauts who spent six months on the ISS are subjected to immunological changes, contribute to explain increased susceptibility to infection, reveal individual responses and consequently that personalized approaches should be implemented during future deep-space exploration missions that will endure for an unprecedented amount of time.

Here, we engineered microscale progenitor cardiac spheres from human pluripotent stem cells and exposed the spheres to simulated microgravity using a random positioning machine for 3 days during their differentiation to cardiomyocytes. Methods: RNA-seq libraries were prepared using the Illumina TruSeq RNA kit and the TrueSeq method was employed for mRNA enrichment. The libraries were quantified and samples were multiplexed in each lane of the flowcell. Cluster generation was performed and then sequenced on the Illumina HiSeq1000 system. Reads were mapped on the Human Genome Reference and normalized expression table was generated. Results: Among differentially expressed genes, 53 of them were up-regulated and 75 were down-regulated. Conclusions: Data demonstrate increased expression of genes associated with growth, development, and pro-survival in cardiac progenitors cultured under simulated microgravity compared with those cultured under standard gravity.

These animals are particularly promising because of their central role in the limnic food web and its mode of reproduction. However, the response of Daphnia to altered gravity conditions has to be investigated, especially on the molecular level, to evaluate the suitability of Daphnia for BLSS in space. Methods: In this study, we applied a proteomic approach to identify key proteins and pathways involved in the response of Daphnia to simulated microgravity generated by a 2D-clinostat. We analysed 5 biological replicates using 2D-DIGE proteomic analysis. Results: We identified 109 protein spots differing in intensity (p < 0.05). Substantial fractions of these proteins are involved in actin microfilament organisation, indicating the disruption of cytoskeletal structures during clinorotation. Furthermore, proteins involved in protein folding were identified, suggesting altered gravity induced breakdown of protein structures in general. In addition, simulated microgravity increased the abundance of energy metabolism related proteins, indicating an enhanced energy demand of Daphnia. Conclusion: The affected biological processes were also described in other studies using different organisms and systems either aiming to simulate microgravity conditions or providing real microgravity conditions. Moreover, most of the Daphnia protein sequences are well conserved throughout taxa, indicating that the response to altered gravity conditions in Daphnia follows a general concept.

These animals are particularly promising because of their central role in the limnic food web and its mode of reproduction. However, the response of Daphnia to altered gravity conditions has to be investigated, especially on the molecular level, to evaluate the suitability of Daphnia for BLSS in space. Methods: In this study, we applied a proteomic approach to identify key proteins and pathways involved in the response of Daphnia to simulated microgravity generated by a 2D-clinostat. We analysed 5 biological replicates using 2D-DIGE proteomic analysis. Results: We identified 109 protein spots differing in intensity (p < 0.05). Substantial fractions of these proteins are involved in actin microfilament organisation, indicating the disruption of cytoskeletal structures during clinorotation. Furthermore, proteins involved in protein folding were identified, suggesting altered gravity induced breakdown of protein structures in general. In addition, simulated microgravity increased the abundance of energy metabolism related proteins, indicating an enhanced energy demand of Daphnia. Conclusion: The affected biological processes were also described in other studies using different organisms and systems either aiming to simulate microgravity conditions or providing real microgravity conditions. Moreover, most of the Daphnia protein sequences are well conserved throughout taxa, indicating that the response to altered gravity conditions in Daphnia follows a general concept.

A prospective collection of gait data was collected on 3 groups of mice: those who spent~35 days in orbit (FLIGHT) aboard the International Space Station (ISS); a ground-based control with the same habitat conditions as ISS (Ground Control; GC); and a vivarium control with typical rodent housing conditions (VIV). Pre-flight and post-flight gait measurements were conducted utilizing an optimized and portable gait analysis system (DigiGait, Mouse Specifics, Inc). The total data acquisition time for gait patterns of FLIGHT and control mice was 1.5–5 min/mouse, allowing all 20 mice per group to be assessed in less than an hour. Patterns of longitudinal gait changes were observed in the hind limbs and the forelimbs of the FLIGHT mice after ~35 days in orbit; few differences were observed in gait characteristics within the GC and VIV controls from the initial to the final gait assessment, and between groups. For FLIGHT mice, 12 out of 18 of the evaluated gait characteristics in the hind limbs were significantly changed, including: stride width variability; stride length and variance; stride, swing, and stance duration; paw angle and area at peak stance; and step angle, among others. Gait characteristics that decreased included stride frequency, and others. Moreover, numerous forelimb gait characteristics in the FLIGHT mice were changed at post-flight measures relative to pre-flight. This rapid DigiGait gait measurement tool and customized spaceflight protocol is useful for providing preliminary insight into how spaceflight could affect multiple systems in rodents in which deficits are reflected by altered gait characteristics. This dataset derives results from the behavior (gait) assay.","This study only uses male mice, so it is impossible to say. ",50284181

On Earth, muscle unloading leads to a disproportionate loss in muscle force and size with the loss in muscle force occurring at a faster rate. Although the exact mechanisms are unknown, a role for Ca2+ dysregulation has been suggested. The sarco(endo)plasmic reticulum Ca2+ ATPase (SERCA) pump actively brings cytosolic Ca2+ into the SR, eliciting muscle relaxation and maintaining low intracellular Ca2+ ([Ca2+]i). SERCA dysfunction contributes to elevations in [Ca2+]i, leading to cellular damage, and may contribute to the muscle weakness and atrophy observed with spaceflight. Here, we investigated SERCA function, SERCA regulatory protein content, and reactive oxygen/nitrogen species (RONS) protein adduction in murine skeletal muscle after 35-37 days of spaceflight. In male and female soleus muscles, spaceflight led to drastic impairments in Ca2+ uptake despite significant increases in SERCA1a protein content. We attribute this impairment to an increase in RONS production and elevated total protein tyrosine (T) nitration and cysteine (S) nitrosylation. Contrarily, in the tibialis anterior (TA), we observed an enhancement in Ca2+ uptake, which we attribute to a shift towards a faster muscle fiber type (i.e., increased myosin heavy chain IIb and SERCA1a) without elevated total protein T-nitration and S-nitrosylation. Thus, spaceflight affects SERCA function differently between the soleus and TA. This dataset derives results from the calcium uptake (spectrofluorometry) and Western blot assays.",The sarcoplasmic reticulum.  ,79827594

Results: Ejection fraction and fractional shortening decreased at 3 and 7 months after 16O. These parameters did not change in mice exposed to γ rays, protons, or protons followed by 16O. Each of the radiation exposures caused only small increases in cleaved caspase3 and numbers of apoptotic nuclei. Changes in the levels of α smooth muscle cell actin and a 75kDa peptide of collagen type III in the left ventricle suggested tissue remodeling, but there was no significant change in total collagen deposition at 2 weeks, 3 months, and 9 months. Increases in protein amounts of cluster of differentiation (CD)2, CD68, and CD45 as measured with immunoblots at 2 weeks, 3 months, and 9 months after exposure to protons or 16O alone suggested immune cell infiltration. For type III collagen, CD2 and CD68, the efficacy in inducing protein abundance of CD2, CD68, and CD45 was 16O greater than protons was greater than γ rays greater than protons followed by 16O.

Results: Ejection fraction and fractional shortening decreased at 3 and 7 months after 16O. These parameters did not change in mice exposed to γ rays, protons, or protons followed by 16O.

In the present study, we evaluated the effects of a 14-day spaceflight on bone mass, bone resorption, bone formation, and MAT in lumbar vertebrae of ovariectomized (OVX) rats. Twelve-week-old OVX Fischer 344 rats were randomly assigned to a ground control or flight group. Following flight, histological sections of the second lumbar vertebrae (n equals 11/group) were stained using a technique that allowed simultaneous quantification of cells and preflight fluorochrome label. Compared with ground controls, rats flown in space had 32% lower cancellous bone area and 306% higher MAT. The increased adiposity was due to an increase in adipocyte number (224%) and size (26%). Mineral apposition rate and osteoblast turnover were unchanged during spaceflight. In contrast, resorption of a preflight fluorochrome and osteoclast-lined bone perimeter were increased (16% and 229%, respectively). The present findings indicate that cancellous bone loss in rat lumbar vertebrae during spaceflight is accompanied by increased bone resorption and MAT but no change in bone formation. These findings do not support the hypothesis that increased MAT during spaceflight reduces osteoblast activity or lifespan. However, in the context of ovarian hormone deficiency, bone formation during spaceflight was insufficient to balance increased resorption, indicating defective coupling. The results are therefore consistent with the hypothesis that during spaceflight mesenchymal stem cells are diverted to adipocytes at the expense of forming osteoblasts.

Because there is concern about the adverse effects of space radiation on the cardiovascular system, this study assessed cardiac function and structure and immune cell infiltration in a mouse model of charged particle irradiation. Materials and methods: Male C57BL/6 J mice were exposed to oxygen ions (16O, 600 MeV/n at 0.25 to 0.26 Gy/min to a total dose of 0, 0.05, 0.1, 0.25, or 1 Gy), protons (150 MeV, 0.35 to 0.55 Gy/min to 0, 0.5, or 1 Gy), or protons (150 MeV, 0.5 Gy) followed by 16O (600 MeV/n, 0.1 Gy). Separate groups of mice received 137Cs γ rays (1 Gy/min to 0, 0.5, 1, or 3 Gy) as a reference. Cardiac function and blood velocity were measured with ultrasonography at 3, 5, 7, and 9 months after irradiation. At 2 weeks, 3 months, and 9 months, cardiac tissue was collected to assess apoptosis, tissue remodeling, and markers of immune cells. Results: Ejection fraction and fractional shortening decreased at 3 and 7 months after 16O. These parameters did not change in mice exposed to γ rays, protons, or protons followed by 16O. Each of the radiation exposures caused only small increases in cleaved caspase3 and numbers of apoptotic nuclei. Changes in the levels of α smooth muscle cell actin and a 75kDa peptide of collagen type III in the left ventricle suggested tissue remodeling, but there was no significant change in total collagen deposition at 2 weeks, 3 months, and 9 months. Increases in protein amounts of cluster of differentiation (CD)2, CD68, and CD45 as measured with immunoblots at 2 weeks, 3 months, and 9 months after exposure to protons or 16O alone suggested immune cell infiltration. For type III collagen, CD2 and CD68, the efficacy in inducing protein abundance of CD2, CD68, and CD45 was 16O greater than protons was greater than γ rays greater than protons followed by 16O. Conclusions: Low dose, high energy charged particle irradiation caused mild changes in cardiac function and tissue remodeling in the mouse.

Because there is concern about the adverse effects of space radiation on the cardiovascular system, this study assessed cardiac function and structure and immune cell infiltration in a mouse model of charged particle irradiation. Materials and methods: Male C57BL/6 J mice were exposed to oxygen ions (16O, 600 MeV/n at 0.25 to 0.26 Gy/min to a total dose of 0, 0.05, 0.1, 0.25, or 1 Gy), protons (150 MeV, 0.35 to 0.55 Gy/min to 0, 0.5, or 1 Gy), or protons (150 MeV, 0.5 Gy) followed by 16O (600 MeV/n, 0.1 Gy). Separate groups of mice received 137Cs γ rays (1 Gy/min to 0, 0.5, 1, or 3 Gy) as a reference. Cardiac function and blood velocity were measured with ultrasonography at 3, 5, 7, and 9 months after irradiation. At 2 weeks, 3 months, and 9 months, cardiac tissue was collected to assess apoptosis, tissue remodeling, and markers of immune cells. Results: Ejection fraction and fractional shortening decreased at 3 and 7 months after 16O. These parameters did not change in mice exposed to γ rays, protons, or protons followed by 16O. Each of the radiation exposures caused only small increases in cleaved caspase3 and numbers of apoptotic nuclei. Changes in the levels of α smooth muscle cell actin and a 75kDa peptide of collagen type III in the left ventricle suggested tissue remodeling, but there was no significant change in total collagen deposition at 2 weeks, 3 months, and 9 months. Increases in protein amounts of cluster of differentiation (CD)2, CD68, and CD45 as measured with immunoblots at 2 weeks, 3 months, and 9 months after exposure to protons or 16O alone suggested immune cell infiltration. For type III collagen, CD2 and CD68, the efficacy in inducing protein abundance of CD2, CD68, and CD45 was 16O greater than protons was greater than γ rays greater than protons followed by 16O.

Because there is concern about the adverse effects of space radiation on the cardiovascular system, this study assessed cardiac function and structure and immune cell infiltration in a mouse model of charged particle irradiation. Materials and methods: Male C57BL/6 J mice were exposed to oxygen ions (16O, 600 MeV/n at 0.25 to 0.26 Gy/min to a total dose of 0, 0.05, 0.1, 0.25, or 1 Gy), protons (150 MeV, 0.35 to 0.55 Gy/min to 0, 0.5, or 1 Gy), or protons (150 MeV, 0.5 Gy) followed by 16O (600 MeV/n, 0.1 Gy). Separate groups of mice received 137Cs γ rays (1 Gy/min to 0, 0.5, 1, or 3 Gy) as a reference. Cardiac function and blood velocity were measured with ultrasonography at 3, 5, 7, and 9 months after irradiation. At 2 weeks, 3 months, and 9 months, cardiac tissue was collected to assess apoptosis, tissue remodeling, and markers of immune cells. Results: Ejection fraction and fractional shortening decreased at 3 and 7 months after 16O. These parameters did not change in mice exposed to γ rays, protons, or protons followed by 16O. Each of the radiation exposures caused only small increases in cleaved caspase3 and numbers of apoptotic nuclei. Changes in the levels of α smooth muscle cell actin and a 75kDa peptide of collagen type III in the left ventricle suggested tissue remodeling, but there was no significant change in total collagen deposition at 2 weeks, 3 months, and 9 months. Increases in protein amounts of cluster of differentiation (CD)2, CD68, and CD45 as measured with immunoblots at 2 weeks, 3 months, and 9 months after exposure to protons or 16O alone suggested immune cell infiltration. For type III collagen, CD2 and CD68, the efficacy in inducing protein abundance of CD2, CD68, and CD45 was 16O greater than protons was greater than γ rays greater than protons followed by 16O.

Genes that are important in establishing the spaceflight responses are being identified, their roles in spaceflight physiological adaptation are increasingly understood, and the fact that different genotypes adapt differently is recognized. However, the basic question of whether these spaceflight responses are actually required for survival has yet to be posed, and the fundamental notion that spaceflight responses may be non-adaptive has yet to be explored. Therefore the experiments presented here were designed to ask if portions of the plant spaceflight response can be genetically removed without causing loss of spaceflight survival and without causing increased stress responses. The CARA experiment compared the spaceflight transcriptome responses in the root tips of two Arabidopsis ecotypes, Col-0 and WS, as well as that of a PhyD mutant of Col-0. When grown with the ambient light of the ISS, phyD plants displayed a significantly reduced spaceflight transcriptome response compared to Col-0, suggesting that altering the activity of a single gene can actually improve spaceflight adaptation by reducing the transcriptome cost of physiological adaptation. The WS genotype showed an even simpler spaceflight transcriptome response in the ambient light of the ISS, more broadly indicating that the plant genotype can be manipulated to reduce the cost of spaceflight adaptation, as measured by transcriptional response. These differential genotypic responses suggest that genetic manipulation could further reduce, or perhaps eliminate the metabolic cost of spaceflight adaptation. When plants were germinated and then left in the dark on the ISS, the WS genotype actually mounted a larger transcriptome response than Col-0, suggesting that the in-space light environment affects physiological adaptation, which implies that manipulating the local habitat can also substantially impact the metabolic cost of spaceflight adaptation.",International Space Station,66419017

Genes that are important in establishing the spaceflight responses are being identified, their roles in spaceflight physiological adaptation are increasingly understood, and the fact that different genotypes adapt differently is recognized. However, the basic question of whether these spaceflight responses are actually required for survival has yet to be posed, and the fundamental notion that spaceflight responses may be non-adaptive has yet to be explored. Therefore the experiments presented here were designed to ask if portions of the plant spaceflight response can be genetically removed without causing loss of spaceflight survival and without causing increased stress responses. The CARA experiment compared the spaceflight transcriptome responses in the root tips of two Arabidopsis ecotypes, Col-0 and WS, as well as that of a PhyD mutant of Col-0. When grown with the ambient light of the ISS, phyD plants displayed a significantly reduced spaceflight transcriptome response compared to Col-0, suggesting that altering the activity of a single gene can actually improve spaceflight adaptation by reducing the transcriptome cost of physiological adaptation. The WS genotype showed an even simpler spaceflight transcriptome response in the ambient light of the ISS, more broadly indicating that the plant genotype can be manipulated to reduce the cost of spaceflight adaptation, as measured by transcriptional response. These differential genotypic responses suggest that genetic manipulation could further reduce, or perhaps eliminate the metabolic cost of spaceflight adaptation. When plants were germinated and then left in the dark on the ISS, the WS genotype actually mounted a larger transcriptome response than Col-0, suggesting that the in-space light environment affects physiological adaptation, which implies that manipulating the local habitat can also substantially impact the metabolic cost of spaceflight adaptation.",13 days,66419017

Gravity affects a plant in every step of its development. Germinating seedlings orient their radicle and hypocotyl and growing plants position organs at a specific Gravitropic Set-point Angle dictated by the asymmetric distribution of auxin depending on the gravity vector. Hence gravitropism is one of the fundamental growth responses in plants. For any experiment studying the effects of gravity on plants, the ultimate control is the microgravity in space. In this study, Arabidopsis seeds were flown to the International Space Station and allowed to germinate and grow for 3 days in microgravity. Arabidopsis Wild Type Col-0 seeds were plated onto twenty-two 60mm Petri plates, loaded into PDFUs and inserted 4 Biological Research in Canisters (BRICs). Approximately 800 seeds were sterilized, plated on each 60mm Petri plates and cold stratified for 16 hours followed by 2 hours of white light treatment. The BRICs were maintained at 4C until spaceflight to ensure seed germination in microgravity. After 3 days of germination and growth, the seedlings were fixed by injecting RNAlater into the chamber. They were kept at ambient temperature for 12 hours followed by freezing at -80C. An additional 22 plates were used as ground controls. After the spaceflight, tissue from five plates was pooled to make each of three replicates. Both membrane and soluble proteins were extracted from the pooled seedlings. Proteins were trypsin digested, labelled with iTRAQ and identified using tandem mass spectrometry.",Biological Research in Canisters (BRICs),40990491

of 1G. Gravity affects a plant in every step of its development. Germinating seedlings orient their radicle and hypocotyl and growing plants position organs at a specific Gravitropic Set-point Angle dictated by the asymmetric distribution of auxin depending on the gravity vector. Hence gravitropism is one of the fundamental growth responses in plants. For any experiment studying the effects of gravity on plants, the ultimate control is the microgravity in space. In this study, Arabidopsis seeds were flown to the International Space Station and allowed to germinate and grow for 3 days in microgravity. Arabidopsis Wild Type Col-0 seeds were plated onto twenty-two 60mm Petri plates, loaded into PDFUs and inserted 4 Biological Research in Canisters (BRICs). Approximately 800 seeds were sterilized, plated on each 60mm Petri plates and cold stratified for 16 hours followed by 2 hours of white light treatment. The BRICs were maintained at 4C until spaceflight to ensure seed germination in microgravity. After 3 days of germination and growth, the seedlings were fixed by injecting RNAlater into the chamber. They were kept at ambient temperature for 12 hours followed by freezing at -80C. An additional 22 plates were used as ground controls. After the spaceflight, tissue from five plates was pooled to make each of three replicates. Both membrane and soluble proteins were extracted from the pooled seedlings. Proteins were trypsin digested, labelled with iTRAQ and identified using tandem mass spectrometry.",Isobaric Tag for Relative and Absolute Quantitation of proteins,40990491

spaceflight environment in three replicated experiments on the International Space Station. Two approaches were used; GFP reporter genes were used to collect gene expression data in real time within unique GFP imaging hardware, and plants were harvested on orbit to RNAlater for subsequent analyses of gene expression with using Affymetrix and SAGE transcriptome analyses. Three tissue types were examined (leaves, hypocotyls and roots) and compared to analyses conducted with whole plants. Transcriptome analyses with whole plants suggested that the spaceflight environment had little impact on the transcriptome of arabidopsis, however, closer examination of selected tissues revealed that there are a number of tissue-specific responses that arabidopsis employs to respond to this novel environment",Advanced Biological Research System,96223291

Arabidopsis seedlings and undifferentiated cultured Arabidopsis cells were launched in April, 2010, as part of the BRIC-16 flight experiment on STS-131. Biologically replicated DNA microarray and averaged RNA digital transcript profiling revealed several hundred genes in seedlings and cell cultures that were significantly affected by launch and spaceflight. The response was moderate in seedlings; only a few genes were induced by more than 7-fold, and the overall intrinsic expression level for most differentially expressed genes was low. In contrast, cell cultures displayed a more dramatic response, with dozens of genes showing this level of differential expression, a list comprised primarily of heat shock-related and stress-related genes. This baseline transcriptome profiling of seedlings and cultured cells confirms the fundamental hypothesis that survival of the spaceflight environment requires adaptive changes that are both governed and displayed by alterations in gene expression. The comparison of intact plants with cultures of undifferentiated cells confirms a second hypothesis: undifferentiated cells can detect spaceflight in the absence of specialized tissue or organized developmental structures known to detect gravity.

The two types of IR exhibit a shared double strand break-repair-related damage response, although they differ slightly in the timing, degree, and ATM-dependence of the response. The ATM-dependent, DNA metabolism-related transcripts of the DSB response were also induced by other DNA damaging agents, but were not induced by conventional stresses. Both Gamma and HZE irradiation induced, at 24 h post-irradiation, ATM-dependent transcripts associated with a variety of conventional stresses; these were overrepresented for pathogen response, rather than DNA metabolism. In contrast, only HZE-irradiated plants, at 1.5 h after irradiation, exhibited an additional and very extensive transcriptional response, shared with plants experiencing extended night. This response was not apparent in gamma-irradiated plants. We treated 5-day-old WT and atm-1 seedlings of Arabidopsis thaliana with 100 Gy of Gamma radiation (over a span of 15 minutes) or 30 Gy of HZE (over a span of approximately 12 minutes). Gamma irradiations were completed at 8:40 am, while HZE irradiations were conducted in two runs (due to space limitations) which were completed at 1:09 and 1:28pm respectively. Gamma treated seedlings were sampled at 10:10 am, 11:40 am, 2:55 pm, 8:40 pm, and 8:40 am. HZE treated seedlings were sampled at 2:39 pm, 4:09 pm, 7:24 pm, 1:09 am, and 1:09 pm. Un-irradiated WT and atm-1 control seedlings were sampled at 10:45 am on Day #1 and 9:15 am on Day #2.

Various DNA damaging agents induce different spectra of DNA damage as well as collateral damage to other cellular components and therefore are not expected to provoke identical responses by the cell. Here we study the effects of two different types of ionizing radiation (IR) treatment, HZE (1 GeV Fe26+ high mass, high charge, and high energy relativistic particles) and gamma photons, on the transcriptome of Arabidopsis thaliana seedlings. Both types of IR induce small clusters of radicals that can result in the formation of double strand breaks (DSBs), but HZE also produces linear arrays of extremely clustered damage. We performed these experiments across a range of time points (1.5-24 h after irradiation) in both wild-type plants and in mutants defective in the DSB-sensing protein kinase ATM. The two types of IR exhibit a shared double strand break-repair-related damage response, although they differ slightly in the timing, degree, and ATM-dependence of the response. The ATM-dependent, DNA metabolism-related transcripts of the DSB response were also induced by other DNA damaging agents, but were not induced by conventional stresses. Both Gamma and HZE irradiation induced, at 24 h post-irradiation, ATM-dependent transcripts associated with a variety of conventional stresses; these were overrepresented for pathogen response, rather than DNA metabolism. In contrast, only HZE-irradiated plants, at 1.5 h after irradiation, exhibited an additional and very extensive transcriptional response, shared with plants experiencing extended night. This response was not apparent in gamma-irradiated plants. We treated 5-day-old WT and atm-1 seedlings of Arabidopsis thaliana with 100 Gy of Gamma radiation (over a span of 15 minutes) or 30 Gy of HZE (over a span of approximately 12 minutes).

We used microarrays to detail the gene expression of space-flown thymic tissue and identified distinct classes of up-regulated genes during this process. We report here microarray gene expression analysis in young adult C57BL/6NTac mice at 8 weeks of age after exposure to spaceflight aboard the space shuttle (STS-118) for a period of 13 days. Upon conclusion of the mission, thymus lobes were extracted from space flown mice (FLT) as well as age- and sex-matched ground control mice similarly housed in animal enclosure modules (AEM). mRNA was extracted and an automated array analysis for gene expression was performed. Examination of the microarray data revealed 970 individual probes that had a 1.5 fold or greater change. When these data were averaged (n equals 4), we identified 12 genes that were significantly up- or down-regulated by at least 1.5 fold after spaceflight (p less than 0.05). Together, these data demonstrate that spaceflight induces significant changes in the thymic mRNA expression of genes that regulate stress, glucocorticoid receptor metabolism, and T cell signaling activity.

We used microarrays to detail the gene expression of space-flown thymic tissue and identified distinct classes of up-regulated genes during this process. We report here microarray gene expression analysis in young adult C57BL/6NTac mice at 8 weeks of age after exposure to spaceflight aboard the space shuttle (STS-118) for a period of 13 days. Upon conclusion of the mission, thymus lobes were extracted from space flown mice (FLT) as well as age- and sex-matched ground control mice similarly housed in animal enclosure modules (AEM). mRNA was extracted and an automated array analysis for gene expression was performed. Examination of the microarray data revealed 970 individual probes that had a 1.5 fold or greater change. When these data were averaged (n equals 4), we identified 12 genes that were significantly up- or down-regulated by at least 1.5 fold after spaceflight (p less than 0.05). Together, these data demonstrate that spaceflight induces significant changes in the thymic mRNA expression of genes that regulate stress, glucocorticoid receptor metabolism, and T cell signaling activity. These data explain, in part, the reported systemic compromise of the immune system after exposure to the microgravity of space.",Affymetrix,57582314

Food crops grown in space experience different environmental conditions than plants grown on Earth (e.g., reduced gravity, elevated radiation levels). To study the effects of space conditions, red romaine lettuce, Lactuca sativa cv ‘Outredgeous,’ plants were grown in Veggie plant growth chambers on the International Space Station (ISS) and compared with ground-grown plants. Multiple plantings were grown on ISS and harvested using either a single, final harvest, or sequential harvests in which several mature leaves were removed from the plants at weekly intervals. Ground controls were grown simultaneously with a 24–72 h delay using ISS environmental data. Food safety of the plants was determined by heterotrophic plate counts for bacteria and fungi, as well as isolate identification using samples taken from the leaves and roots. Molecular characterization was conducted using Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) to provide taxonomic composition and phylogenetic structure of the community. Leaves were also analyzed for elemental composition, as well as levels of phenolics, anthocyanins, and Oxygen Radical Absorbance Capacity (ORAC). Comparison of flight and ground tissues showed some differences in total counts for bacteria and yeast/molds (2.14 – 4.86 log10 CFU/g), while screening for select human pathogens yielded negative results. Bacterial and fungal isolate identification and community characterization indicated variation in the diversity of genera between leaf and root tissue with diversity being higher in root tissue, and included differences in the dominant genera. The only difference between ground and flight experiments was seen in the third experiment, VEG-03A, with significant differences in the genera from leaf tissue. Flight and ground tissue showed differences in Fe, K, Na, P, S, and Zn content and total phenolic levels, but no differences in anthocyanin and ORAC levels. This study indicated that leafy vegetable crops can produce safe, edible, fresh food to supplement to the astronauts’ diet, and provide baseline data for continual operation of the Veggie plant growth units on ISS.",Lactuca sativa,75215046

Food crops grown in space experience different environmental conditions than plants grown on Earth (e.g., reduced gravity, elevated radiation levels). To study the effects of space conditions, red romaine lettuce, Lactuca sativa cv ‘Outredgeous,’ plants were grown in Veggie plant growth chambers on the International Space Station (ISS) and compared with ground-grown plants. Multiple plantings were grown on ISS and harvested using either a single, final harvest, or sequential harvests in which several mature leaves were removed from the plants at weekly intervals. Ground controls were grown simultaneously with a 24–72 h delay using ISS environmental data. Food safety of the plants was determined by heterotrophic plate counts for bacteria and fungi, as well as isolate identification using samples taken from the leaves and roots. Molecular characterization was conducted using Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) to provide taxonomic composition and phylogenetic structure of the community. Leaves were also analyzed for elemental composition, as well as levels of phenolics, anthocyanins, and Oxygen Radical Absorbance Capacity (ORAC). Comparison of flight and ground tissues showed some differences in total counts for bacteria and yeast/molds (2.14 – 4.86 log10 CFU/g), while screening for select human pathogens yielded negative results. Bacterial and fungal isolate identification and community characterization indicated variation in the diversity of genera between leaf and root tissue with diversity being higher in root tissue, and included differences in the dominant genera. The only difference between ground and flight experiments was seen in the third experiment, VEG-03A, with significant differences in the genera from leaf tissue. Flight and ground tissue showed differences in Fe, K, Na, P, S, and Zn content and total phenolic levels, but no differences in anthocyanin and ORAC levels. This study indicated that leafy vegetable crops can produce safe, edible, fresh food to supplement to the astronauts’ diet, and provide baseline data for continual operation of the Veggie plant growth units on ISS.",Veggie plant growth chambers,75215046

Food crops grown in space experience different environmental conditions than plants grown on Earth (e.g., reduced gravity, elevated radiation levels). To study the effects of space conditions, red romaine lettuce, Lactuca sativa cv ‘Outredgeous,’ plants were grown in Veggie plant growth chambers on the International Space Station (ISS) and compared with ground-grown plants. Multiple plantings were grown on ISS and harvested using either a single, final harvest, or sequential harvests in which several mature leaves were removed from the plants at weekly intervals. Ground controls were grown simultaneously with a 24–72 h delay using ISS environmental data. Food safety of the plants was determined by heterotrophic plate counts for bacteria and fungi, as well as isolate identification using samples taken from the leaves and roots. Molecular characterization was conducted using Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) to provide taxonomic composition and phylogenetic structure of the community. Leaves were also analyzed for elemental composition, as well as levels of phenolics, anthocyanins, and Oxygen Radical Absorbance Capacity (ORAC). Comparison of flight and ground tissues showed some differences in total counts for bacteria and yeast/molds (2.14 – 4.86 log10 CFU/g), while screening for select human pathogens yielded negative results. Bacterial and fungal isolate identification and community characterization indicated variation in the diversity of genera between leaf and root tissue with diversity being higher in root tissue, and included differences in the dominant genera. The only difference between ground and flight experiments was seen in the third experiment, VEG-03A, with significant differences in the genera from leaf tissue. Flight and ground tissue showed differences in Fe, K, Na, P, S, and Zn content and total phenolic levels, but no differences in anthocyanin and ORAC levels. This study indicated that leafy vegetable crops can produce safe, edible, fresh food to supplement to the astronauts’ diet, and provide baseline data for continual operation of the Veggie plant growth units on ISS.",Christina Khodadad,75215046

Compared with ground controls, rats flown in space had 32% lower cancellous bone area and 306% higher MAT. The increased adiposity was due to an increase in adipocyte number (224%) and size (26%). Mineral apposition rate and osteoblast turnover were unchanged during spaceflight. In contrast, resorption of a preflight fluorochrome and osteoclast-lined bone perimeter were increased (16% and 229%, respectively). The present findings indicate that cancellous bone loss in rat lumbar vertebrae during spaceflight is accompanied by increased bone resorption and MAT but no change in bone formation. These findings do not support the hypothesis that increased MAT during spaceflight reduces osteoblast activity or lifespan. However, in the context of ovarian hormone deficiency, bone formation during spaceflight was insufficient to balance increased resorption, indicating defective coupling. The results are therefore consistent with the hypothesis that during spaceflight mesenchymal stem cells are diverted to adipocytes at the expense of forming osteoblasts.

MAT is increased in rodents during spaceflight but a causal relationship between MAT and bone loss remains unclear. In the present study, we evaluated the effects of a 14-day spaceflight on bone mass, bone resorption, bone formation, and MAT in lumbar vertebrae of ovariectomized (OVX) rats. Twelve-week-old OVX Fischer 344 rats were randomly assigned to a ground control or flight group. Following flight, histological sections of the second lumbar vertebrae (n equals 11/group) were stained using a technique that allowed simultaneous quantification of cells and preflight fluorochrome label. Compared with ground controls, rats flown in space had 32% lower cancellous bone area and 306% higher MAT. The increased adiposity was due to an increase in adipocyte number (224%) and size (26%). Mineral apposition rate and osteoblast turnover were unchanged during spaceflight. In contrast, resorption of a preflight fluorochrome and osteoclast-lined bone perimeter were increased (16% and 229%, respectively). The present findings indicate that cancellous bone loss in rat lumbar vertebrae during spaceflight is accompanied by increased bone resorption and MAT but no change in bone formation. These findings do not support the hypothesis that increased MAT during spaceflight reduces osteoblast activity or lifespan. However, in the context of ovarian hormone deficiency, bone formation during spaceflight was insufficient to balance increased resorption, indicating defective coupling. The results are therefore consistent with the hypothesis that during spaceflight mesenchymal stem cells are diverted to adipocytes at the expense of forming osteoblasts. This dataset derives results from the bone histomorphometry assay.",No,99891528

Animal models of hindlimb suspension are widely used to assess alterations in skeleton during the course of complete unloading. More recently, the effects of partial unloading on the musculoskeletal system have been interrogated in mice and rats, revealing dose-dependent effects of partial weight bearing (PWB) on the skeleton and skeletal muscle. Here, we extended these studies to determine the structural and functional skeletal alterations in 14-week-old male Wister rats exposed to 20%, 40%, 70%, or 100% of body weight for 1, 2, or 4 weeks (n  equals 11–12/group). Using in vivo pQCT, we found that trabecular bone density at the proximal tibia declined in proportion to the degree of unloading and continued progressively with time, without evidence of a plateau by 4 weeks. Ex vivo measurements of trabecular microarchitecture in the distal femur by microcomputed tomography revealed deficits in bone volume fraction, 2 and 4 weeks after unloading. Histologic analyses of trabecular bone in the distal femur revealed the decreased osteoblast number and mineralizing surface in unloaded rats. Three-point bending of the femoral diaphysis indicated modest or no reductions in femoral stiffness and estimated modulus due to PWB. Our results suggest that this rat model of PWB leads to trabecular bone deterioration that is progressive and generally proportional to the degree of PWB, with minimal effects on cortical bone. This study derives results from the Mechanical Testing, Bone Microstructure (microCT), and bone histomorphometry assays using femur tissue.",14-week-old ,82434357

Animal models of hindlimb suspension are widely used to assess alterations in skeleton during the course of complete unloading. More recently, the effects of partial unloading on the musculoskeletal system have been interrogated in mice and rats, revealing dose-dependent effects of partial weight bearing (PWB) on the skeleton and skeletal muscle. Here, we extended these studies to determine the structural and functional skeletal alterations in 14-week-old male Wister rats exposed to 20%, 40%, 70%, or 100% of body weight for 1, 2, or 4 weeks (n  equals 11–12/group). Using in vivo pQCT, we found that trabecular bone density at the proximal tibia declined in proportion to the degree of unloading and continued progressively with time, without evidence of a plateau by 4 weeks. Ex vivo measurements of trabecular microarchitecture in the distal femur by microcomputed tomography revealed deficits in bone volume fraction, 2 and 4 weeks after unloading. Histologic analyses of trabecular bone in the distal femur revealed the decreased osteoblast number and mineralizing surface in unloaded rats. Three-point bending of the femoral diaphysis indicated modest or no reductions in femoral stiffness and estimated modulus due to PWB. Our results suggest that this rat model of PWB leads to trabecular bone deterioration that is progressive and generally proportional to the degree of PWB, with minimal effects on cortical bone. This study derives results from the Mechanical Testing, Bone Microstructure (microCT), and bone histomorphometry assays using femur tissue.",Version 2,82434357

Vetted batches of seeds were planted on Phytagel plates. One genotype was planted per plate, and six plates were planted of each genotype. One complete set of 18 plates was planted for growth on the International Space Station (ISS), and a comparable set of 18 plates was planted 24 hours later for the ground controls. The plates were wrapped such that every surface of the plate was covered by at least two layers of Duvetyne Black-Out cloth (Seattle Fabrics) to help preserve dormancy. The plates were stored at 4C until launch (six days). The plates of the CARA experiment launched on April 18th, 2014 in a cold-stow bag to maintain the plates at 4C within the Dragon Capsule. The dormant plates were activated on the ISS by bringing them out of cold stowage and removing the Black-Out cloth wrapping, 12 days after launch. The plants were allowed to grow on orbit for 13 days; some in the ambient light of ISS and some in the dark. A standard light meter was not available on the ISS, so ambient light levels were approximated through the use of iPad (iPad3, iOS 5.1.1) application 'Light Meter HD- lux measurement tool', which was executed by astronaut Steve Swanson. Light Treatment Group: It was estimated that the light-grown plates received between 4-6 micromoles per square meter per second of total light. Dark Treatment Group: The dark-grown plates were first activated by exposure to light, (the Black-Out cloth was removed from the designated plates for 4 hours), and then re-wrapped in Black-Out cloth for the duration of the growth period.",he dormant plates were activated on the ISS by bringing them out of cold stowage and removing the Black-Out cloth wrapping.,58913353

The plates were wrapped such that every surface of the plate was covered by at least two layers of Duvetyne Black-Out cloth (Seattle Fabrics) to help preserve dormancy. The plates were stored at 4C until launch (six days). The plates of the CARA experiment launched on April 18th, 2014 in a cold-stow bag to maintain the plates at 4C within the Dragon Capsule. The dormant plates were activated on the ISS by bringing them out of cold stowage and removing the Black-Out cloth wrapping, 12 days after launch.

Gravity affects a plant in every step of its development. Germinating seedlings orient their radicle and hypocotyl and growing plants position organs at a specific Gravitropic Set-point Angle dictated by the asymmetric distribution of auxin depending on the gravity vector. Hence gravitropism is one of the fundamental growth responses in plants. For any experiment studying the effects of gravity on plants, the ultimate control is the microgravity in space. In this study, Arabidopsis seeds were flown to the International Space Station and allowed to germinate and grow for 3 days in microgravity.

Gravity affects a plant in every step of its development. Germinating seedlings orient their radicle and hypocotyl and growing plants position organs at a specific Gravitropic Set-point Angle dictated by the asymmetric distribution of auxin depending on the gravity vector. Hence gravitropism is one of the fundamental growth responses in plants. For any experiment studying the effects of gravity on plants, the ultimate control is the microgravity in space. In this study, Arabidopsis seeds were flown to the International Space Station and allowed to germinate and grow for 3 days in microgravity. Arabidopsis Wild Type Col-0 seeds were plated onto twenty-two 60mm Petri plates, loaded into PDFUs and inserted 4 Biological Research in Canisters (BRICs). Approximately 800 seeds were sterilized, plated on each 60mm Petri plates and cold stratified for 16 hours followed by 2 hours of white light treatment. The BRICs were maintained at 4C until spaceflight to ensure seed germination in microgravity. After 3 days of germination and growth, the seedlings were fixed by injecting RNAlater into the chamber. They were kept at ambient temperature for 12 hours followed by freezing at -80C. An additional 22 plates were used as ground controls.

A great deal of information has been available on the vegetative stage in space, but relatively little is known about the influence of spaceflight on plants at the reproductive stage. In this study, we constructed a transgenic Arabidopsis thaliana plants expressing flowering control gene, FLOWERING LOCUS T (FT), together with green fluorescent protein gene(GFP) under control of a heat shock-inducible promoter (HSP17.4), by which we induced FT expression inflight through remote controlling heating shock (HS) treatment. Inflight photography data showed that induction of FT expression in plants in space under short-day condition could eliminated the difference of stem length between spaceflight and ground control . Whole-genome microarray analysis of gene expression changes in leaves of wild-type and these transgenic plants grown under the long-day and short-day photoperiod conditions in space indicated that the function of the photoperiod-related spaceflight responsive genes are mainly involved in protein synthesis and post-translation protein modulation, notably protein phosphorylation. In addition, changes of circadian component gene expression in response to spaceflight under different photoperiod indicated that roles of circadian oscillator could act as integrators of spaceflight response and photoperiodic signals in Arabidopsis plants grown in space.","These genes are mainly involved in protein synthesis and post-translation protein modulation, notably protein phosphorylation.",60253103

Using samples from Apollo 11, 12 and 17, we show that the terrestrial plant Arabidopsis thaliana germinates and grows in diverse lunar regoliths. However, our results show that growth is challenging; the lunar regolith plants were slow to develop, expressed genes indicative of ionic stresses, and many showed severe stress morphologies. Therefore, although in situ lunar regolith can be useful for plant production in lunar habitats, they are not benign substrates. The interaction between plants and lunar regolith will need to be further elucidated, and likely mitigated, to enable efficient use of lunar regolith for life support.",Col-0 was the ecotype of Arabidopsis thaliana that was used in this study.,73688959

Altered gravity was achieved by growing seedlings on the ISS within the centrifuge of the European Modular Cultivation System (EMCS) and applying a specific rotation rate for a fixed time in the experiment. Seeds of wild-type (Col-0) and starchless (pgm-1) were used to determine the contribution of statoliths to gravity perception. Plants experienced an estimated 0.003 up to 1.0 g depending on the specific experimental run and position of the seed cassette on the centrifuge arm. Images were captured at various points during the experiment and at the conclusion of the 5-day growth period.,pgm-1 is the name of the starchless mutant that was used in this study.,13176837

responses to a range of gravity treatments. Altered gravity was achieved by growing seedlings on the ISS within the centrifuge of the European Modular Cultivation System (EMCS) and applying a specific rotation rate for a fixed time in the experiment. Seeds of wild-type (Col-0) and starchless (pgm-1) were used to determine the contribution of statoliths to gravity perception. Plants experienced an estimated 0.003 up to 1.0 g depending on the specific experimental run and position of the seed cassette on the centrifuge arm. Images were captured at various points during the experiment and at the conclusion of the 5-day growth period.,Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer was used for the QA of nucleic acid extraction.,13176837

Lateral root organogenesis is a key process in the development of a plant’s root system and its adaptation to the environment. During lateral root formation, an early phase of cell proliferation first produces a four-cell-layered primordium, and only from this stage onwards is a root meristem-like structure, expressing root stem cell niche marker genes, being established in the developing organ. Previous studies reported that the gene regulatory network controlling lateral root formation is organized into two subnetworks whose mutual inhibition may contribute to organ patterning. PUCHI encodes an AP2/ERF transcription factor expressed early during lateral root primordium development and required for correct lateral root formation. To dissect the molecular events occurring during this early phase, we generated time-series transcriptomic datasets profiling lateral root development in puchi-1 mutants and wild types. Transcriptomic and reporter analyses revealed that meristem-related genes were expressed ectopically at early stages of lateral root formation in puchi-1 mutants. We conclude that, consistent with the inhibition of genetic modules contributing to lateral root development, PUCHI represses ectopic establishment of meristematic cell identities at early stages of organ development. These findings shed light on gene network properties that orchestrate correct timing and patterning during lateral root formation.",A four cell-layered primordium is produced during an early phase of cell proliferation in lateral root formation.,23432593

Transcriptomic profiling of the response of the Arabidopsis ecotype Wassilewskija (WS) to the aggregate spaceflight experiences in the Blue Origin New Shepard and Virgin Galactic SpaceShipTwo rockets revealed that the transcriptomic load induced by flight differed greatly between the two flights, yet was biologically related to traditional parabolic flight responses.

Despite the differing genotypes, experimental workflows, flight profiles and platforms, alteration of gene expression remodeling central metabolic processes was commonly observed as a response to the flights.

Transcriptomic profiling of the response of the Arabidopsis ecotype Wassilewskija (WS) to the aggregate spaceflight experiences in the Blue Origin New Shepard and Virgin Galactic SpaceShipTwo rockets revealed that the transcriptomic load induced by flight differed greatly between the two flights, yet was biologically related to traditional parabolic flight responses.

An additional parabolic flight using the F-104 Starfighter showed that the response of 14-3-3κ:GFP to flight was modulated in a similar manner to the WS line. Despite the differing genotypes, experimental workflows, flight profiles and platforms, alteration of gene expression remodeling central metabolic processes was commonly observed as a response to the flights. The processes included carbon and nitrogen metabolism, branched-chain amino acid degradation, and hypoxic responses. The timing and directionality of differentially-expressed genes involved in the conserved pathways differed among the platforms. The data presented herein highlight the potential for various suborbital platforms to contribute insights into biological responses to spaceflight, and further suggest that in-flight fixation during suborbital experiments will provide insights into responses to each phase of flight.

This paper presents an initial comparison of the responses of Arabidopsis thaliana to suborbital and atmospheric parabolic flights as an important step toward characterizing these emerging suborbital platforms and their effects on biology. Transcriptomic profiling of the response of the Arabidopsis ecotype Wassilewskija (WS) to the aggregate spaceflight experiences in the Blue Origin New Shepard and Virgin Galactic SpaceShipTwo rockets revealed that the transcriptomic load induced by flight differed greatly between the two flights, yet was biologically related to traditional parabolic flight responses. The sku5 skewing mutant and 14-3-3κ:GFP regulatory protein overexpression lines each showed altered intra-platform responses compared to WS in the Blue Origin and parabolic flights, respectively. An additional parabolic flight using the F-104 Starfighter showed that the response of 14-3-3κ:GFP to flight was modulated in a similar manner to the WS line. Despite the differing genotypes, experimental workflows, flight profiles and platforms, alteration of gene expression remodeling central metabolic processes was commonly observed as a response to the flights. The processes included carbon and nitrogen metabolism, branched-chain amino acid degradation, and hypoxic responses. The timing and directionality of differentially-expressed genes involved in the conserved pathways differed among the platforms. The data presented herein highlight the potential for various suborbital platforms to contribute insights into biological responses to spaceflight, and further suggest that in-flight fixation during suborbital experiments will provide insights into responses to each phase of flight.",Wassilewskija.,40073257

This paper presents an initial comparison of the responses of Arabidopsis thaliana to suborbital and atmospheric parabolic flights as an important step toward characterizing these emerging suborbital platforms and their effects on biology. Transcriptomic profiling of the response of the Arabidopsis ecotype Wassilewskija (WS) to the aggregate spaceflight experiences in the Blue Origin New Shepard and Virgin Galactic SpaceShipTwo rockets revealed that the transcriptomic load induced by flight differed greatly between the two flights, yet was biologically related to traditional parabolic flight responses. The sku5 skewing mutant and 14-3-3κ:GFP regulatory protein overexpression lines each showed altered intra-platform responses compared to WS in the Blue Origin and parabolic flights, respectively. An additional parabolic flight using the F-104 Starfighter showed that the response of 14-3-3κ:GFP to flight was modulated in a similar manner to the WS line. Despite the differing genotypes, experimental workflows, flight profiles and platforms, alteration of gene expression remodeling central metabolic processes was commonly observed as a response to the flights. The processes included carbon and nitrogen metabolism, branched-chain amino acid degradation, and hypoxic responses. The timing and directionality of differentially-expressed genes involved in the conserved pathways differed among the platforms. The data presented herein highlight the potential for various suborbital platforms to contribute insights into biological responses to spaceflight, and further suggest that in-flight fixation during suborbital experiments will provide insights into responses to each phase of flight.",Affymetrix was the platform used for transcription profiling.,40073257

A great deal of information has been available on the vegetative stage in space, but relatively little is known about the influence of spaceflight on plants at the reproductive stage. In this study, we constructed a transgenic Arabidopsis thaliana plants expressing flowering control gene, FLOWERING LOCUS T (FT), together with green fluorescent protein gene(GFP) under control of a heat shock-inducible promoter (HSP17.4), by which we induced FT expression inflight through remote controlling heating shock (HS) treatment. Inflight photography data showed that induction of FT expression in plants in space under short-day condition could eliminated the difference of stem length between spaceflight and ground control . Whole-genome microarray analysis of gene expression changes in leaves of wild-type and these transgenic plants grown under the long-day and short-day photoperiod conditions in space indicated that the function of the photoperiod-related spaceflight responsive genes are mainly involved in protein synthesis and post-translation protein modulation, notably protein phosphorylation. In addition, changes of circadian component gene expression in response to spaceflight under different photoperiod indicated that roles of circadian oscillator could act as integrators of spaceflight response and photoperiodic signals in Arabidopsis plants grown in space.",Protein phosphorylation is a post-translational modification of proteins in which an amino acid residue is phosphorylated by a protein kinase by the addition of a covalently bound phosphate group.

Separate groups of mice received 137Cs γ rays (1 Gy/min to 0, 0.5, 1, or 3 Gy) as a reference. Cardiac function and blood velocity were measured with ultrasonography at 3, 5, 7, and 9 months after irradiation. At 2 weeks, 3 months, and 9 months, cardiac tissue was collected to assess apoptosis, tissue remodeling, and markers of immune cells. Results: Ejection fraction and fractional shortening decreased at 3 and 7 months after 16O. These parameters did not change in mice exposed to γ rays, protons, or protons followed by 16O. Each of the radiation exposures caused only small increases in cleaved caspase3 and numbers of apoptotic nuclei. Changes in the levels of α smooth muscle cell actin and a 75kDa peptide of collagen type III in the left ventricle suggested tissue remodeling, but there was no significant change in total collagen deposition at 2 weeks, 3 months, and 9 months. Increases in protein amounts of cluster of differentiation (CD)2, CD68, and CD45 as measured with immunoblots at 2 weeks, 3 months, and 9 months after exposure to protons or 16O alone suggested immune cell infiltration. For type III collagen, CD2 and CD68, the efficacy in inducing protein abundance of CD2, CD68, and CD45 was 16O greater than protons was greater than γ rays greater than protons followed by 16O. Conclusions: Low dose, high energy charged particle irradiation caused mild changes in cardiac function and tissue remodeling in the mouse.

work?,"Astronauts traveling beyond low Earth orbit will be exposed to high linear energy transfer charged particles. Because there is concern about the adverse effects of space radiation on the cardiovascular system, this study assessed cardiac function and structure and immune cell infiltration in a mouse model of charged particle irradiation. Materials and methods: Male C57BL/6 J mice were exposed to oxygen ions (16O, 600 MeV/n at 0.25 to 0.26 Gy/min to a total dose of 0, 0.05, 0.1, 0.25, or 1 Gy), protons (150 MeV, 0.35 to 0.55 Gy/min to 0, 0.5, or 1 Gy), or protons (150 MeV, 0.5 Gy) followed by 16O (600 MeV/n, 0.1 Gy). Separate groups of mice received 137Cs γ rays (1 Gy/min to 0, 0.5, 1, or 3 Gy) as a reference. Cardiac function and blood velocity were measured with ultrasonography at 3, 5, 7, and 9 months after irradiation. At 2 weeks, 3 months, and 9 months, cardiac tissue was collected to assess apoptosis, tissue remodeling, and markers of immune cells. Results: Ejection fraction and fractional shortening decreased at 3 and 7 months after 16O. These parameters did not change in mice exposed to γ rays, protons, or protons followed by 16O. Each of the radiation exposures caused only small increases in cleaved caspase3 and numbers of apoptotic nuclei. Changes in the levels of α smooth muscle cell actin and a 75kDa peptide of collagen type III in the left ventricle suggested tissue remodeling, but there was no significant change in total collagen deposition at 2 weeks, 3 months, and 9 months. Increases in protein amounts of cluster of differentiation (CD)2, CD68, and CD45 as measured with immunoblots at 2 weeks, 3 months, and 9 months after exposure to protons or 16O alone suggested immune cell infiltration. For type III collagen, CD2 and CD68, the efficacy in inducing protein abundance of CD2, CD68, and CD45 was 16O greater than protons was greater than γ rays greater than protons followed by 16O. Conclusions: Low dose, high energy charged particle irradiation caused mild changes in cardiac function and tissue remodeling in the mouse. This dataset derives result from the cardiac ultrasound and abdominal aorta doppler (echocardiography) assays.",it uses sound waves to create images of the aorta,71223240

Due to the limited resources for conducting biological experiments aboard the International Space Station (ISS), it is imperative to use crew time efficiently while maximizing high-quality science return. NASA's GeneLab project has as its primary objectives to 1) further increase the value of these experiments using a multi-omics, systems biology-based approach, and 2) disseminate these data without restrictions to the scientific community. The current investigation assessed viability of RNA, DNA, and protein extracted from archived RR-1 tissue samples for epigenomic, transcriptomic, and proteomic assays. During the first RR spaceflight experiment, a variety of tissue types were harvested from subjects, snap-frozen or RNAlater-preserved, and then stored at least a year at -80C after return to Earth. They were then prioritized for this investigation based on likelihood of significant scientific value for spaceflight research. All tissues were made available to GeneLab through the bio-specimen sharing program managed by the Ames Life Science Data Archive and included mouse adrenal glands, quadriceps, gastrocnemius, tibialis anterior, extensor digitorum longus, soleus, eye, and kidney. We report here protocols for and results of these tissue extractions, and thus, the feasibility and value of these kinds of omics analyses. In addition to providing additional opportunities for investigation of spaceflight effects on the mouse transcriptome and proteome in new kinds of tissues, our results may also be of value to program managers for the prioritization of ISS crew time for rodent research activities.","2, Whole Genome Bisulfite Sequencing and RNA Sequencing",58930736
