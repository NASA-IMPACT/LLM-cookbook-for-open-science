A process of spatially allocating Gross Domestic Product (GDP) based upon the Sachs et al. (2003) methodology is utilized.

The contribution rates are then applied to published World Bank Development Indicators to determine a GDP value for the subnational unit.

Because of the lack of globally consistent data on migration, indirect estimation methods were used. The authors relied on a combination of data on spatial population distribution for four time slices (1970, 1980, 1990, and 2000) and subnational rates of natural increase in order to derive estimates of net migration on a 30 arc-second (~1km) grid cell basis. Net migration was estimated by subtracting the population in time period 2 from the population in time period 1, and then subtracting the natural increase (births minus deaths). The residual was considered to be net migration (in-migrants minus out-migrants). The authors ran 13 geospatial net migration estimation models based on outputs from the same number of imputation runs for urban and rural rates of natural increase.This data set represents the average of those runs. These data are reliable at broad scales of analysis (e.g. ecosystems or regions), but are generally not reliable for local level analyses.

Global Multihazard Proportional Economic Loss Risk Deciles,"Disasters,Climate Change,Human Dimensions","The Global Multihazard Proportional Economic Loss Risks is a 2.5 minute grid of a multihazard-based economic loss risk as a proportion of the economic productivity of the analytical unit, the grid cell. Representation of multihazard risk is not based on a multihazard index but rather on combinations of hazard risk categories, drought, seismic, and hydro. The drought category includes drought only. The seismic category consists of earthquake and volcano hazards. Cyclones, floods, and landslides are included in the hydro category. For each of the six hazards considered, a binary risk surface is constructed utilizing the three most-at-risk deciles of each hazard's global proportional economic loss risks data set (deciles 8-10). Each of the category risk surfaces are constructed by adding all the relevant hazard high-risk surfaces. These categorical risk surfaces are reclassified into binary high-risk surfaces. The combination of the category risk values forms a three digit identifier for determining those locations that are at higher-risk from multihazards. This data set is the result of collaboration among the Columbia University Center for Hazards and Risk Research (CHRR), International Bank for Reconstruction and Development/The World Bank, and Columbia University Center for International Earth Science Information Network (CIESIN).","The Global Multihazard Proportional Economic Loss Risks shows the multihazard-based economic loss risk as a proportion of economic productivity.

Global Multihazard Total Economic Loss Risk Deciles,"Disasters,Climate Change,Human Dimensions","The Global Multihazard Total Economic Loss Risk Deciles is a 2.5 minute grid of global multihazard total economic loss risks. First, for each of the considered hazards (cyclones, droughts, earthquakes, floods, landslides, and volcanoes), subnational distributions of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) are computed using a methodology developed from Sachs et al. (2003). Where applicable, the contributions of subnational units to national GDP estimates, the contribution ratio, are determined using data of varied origin. World Bank Development Indicators are substituted for GDP estimates of varied origin and the subnational GDP is estimated using the fore mentioned contribution ratios. A subnational, per capita GDP is derived and a final GDP estimate per grid cell is made based on grid cell population density. A raw, total economic loss is computed per grid cell using a regional economic loss rate derived from EM-DAT records. To more accurately reflect the confidence surrounding the economic loss estimate, the range of losses are classified into deciles, 10 classes of an approximately equal number of grid cells. A multihazard index is generated by summing the top three deciles of the individual hazards. This data set is the result of collaboration among the Columbia University Center for Hazards and Risk Research (CHRR), International Bank for Reconstruction and Development/The World Bank, and Columbia University Center for International Earth Science Information Network (CIESIN).","The Global Multihazard Proportional Economic Loss Risks shows the total economic loss risk by combining the risk of several types of hazards.

SVI values range between 0 and 1 based on their percentile position among all census tracts in the U.S., with 0 representing lowest vulnerability census tracts and 1 representing highest vulnerability census tracts.

Consequently, these data are well suited for use in support of fire management (e.g., near real-time alert systems), as well as other science applications requiring improved fire mapping fidelity.
