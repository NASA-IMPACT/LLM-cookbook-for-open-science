Preprocessing Landsat 8 Level-1 data involves several steps to ensure accurate and usable data for analysis. Here's a complete sequence of steps:

- Data Acquisition and Download:
  - Visit the USGS EarthExplorer website or other reliable sources for Landsat data.
  - Select Landsat 8 as the satellite and define the area and time period you're interested in.
  - Download the Level-1 data for the desired scene.
- Data Preparation:
  - Extract the downloaded data to a dedicated folder on your computer.
- Georeferencing:
  - Use ENVI's georeferencing tools to ensure that the image is properly aligned with a known coordinate system.
  - Choose ground control points (GCPs) from a reliable source such as a georeferenced base map or high-resolution imagery.
  - Perform the georeferencing process and save the output.
- Conversion to Radiance:
  - Open the georeferenced Landsat 8 image in ENVI.
  - Use the metadata provided with the image to convert digital numbers (DN) to radiance values.
  - Apply the appropriate conversion coefficients provided by the Landsat documentation for each spectral band.
- Solar Corrections:
  - Calculate solar angles for the acquisition date and time using tools within ENVI or external software.
  - Apply the appropriate correction factors to adjust for variations in solar irradiance at the time of image acquisition.
  - Ensure consistency across all spectral bands.
- Atmospheric Corrections:
  - Perform atmospheric correction to remove the effects of atmospheric scattering and absorption.
  - Use ENVI's atmospheric correction tools or external software such as FLAASH or QUAC to apply corrections.
  - Select an appropriate atmospheric model (e.g., MODTRAN) and input parameters such as aerosol optical depth and water vapor content.
- Additional Processing (Optional):
  - Conduct additional processing steps such as image sharpening, noise reduction, or spectral enhancement based on the specific requirements of your analysis.
- Data Export:
  - Export the preprocessed Landsat data to a format suitable for further analysis, such as GeoTIFF or ENVI raster format.
  - Ensure that the exported data retains the necessary geospatial information for accurate interpretation and analysis.
- Quality Assessment:
  - Perform a visual and quantitative assessment of the preprocessed data to ensure that it meets your quality standards.
  - Check for artifacts, anomalies, or inconsistencies that may affect the accuracy of your analysis.
- Documentation:
  - Document the preprocessing steps undertaken, including parameter settings, software used, and any adjustments made to the data.
  - Maintain metadata associated with the preprocessed data to facilitate reproducibility and data sharing.

By following these steps, you should be able to preprocess Landsat 8 Level-1 data effectively for your intended analysis.
